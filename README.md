# What is this project?

This project is to encourage international visitors to go hiking with the local people in Taiwan.

# Why this project is useful?

I came across some tourists from different countries and they told me they enjoyed their hikes in Taiwan.
But it seems that there are not many websites about how active the local hiking groups are in Taiwan.
Those hiking groups hold free hikes every weekend and they welcome people to join them.
There are many benefits to hike with a group, especially in a foreign country,
and the biggest benefit is the safety.
I hope those tourists will enjoy their hike in Taiwan safely and they can also meet local people.

# What are the challenges?

The biggest challenge other than coding is the language.
As you can see, the language from those hiking groups is Chinese, and I have to 'turn' it into English.
Obviously, translating it into English isn't an option.
My current solution is to use web scraping to retrieve the data from the websites of those hiking groups with their permission,
organize them manually, and store them as API.
If you have a better solution, please feel free to let me know. I appreciate your kind help.

# How you can help?

This is an one-person project. Any suggestions regarding the user interface, user experience, layout, typos, etc., are welcome.
I'm a code newbie and it's for sure I'm making a lot mistakes and the coding process takes time for me to finish.
Or just stopping by and saying hello is appreciated.
