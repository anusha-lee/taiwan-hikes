This walkway is gentle and paved with old platforms Debris on the driveway, walk about half an hour to reach the old mine of Jianyuan Coal Mine. Abandoned pits, arch bridges, the site of the mining office and stone temples are still left nearby. The mountain trails are relatively rugged and slippery, but with the help of steel nails and cables, it is not difficult to pass. The trees are dense and full of ancient atmosphere along the way."
