          1. A Wide Variety of Landscapes: from Post-volcanic Landscape to
          Possible Glacier Traces

        <div class="article__content">
          <div class="article__content--text">
            70% of the area in Taiwan is covered by mountains, and there is a
            wide range of terrains. If you want to experience post-volcanic
            activities and see the craters still spewing smoke, it’s in Taipei
            City. If you prefer to explore the lush jungles with waterfalls, you
            have several places to see and you can get there by train or bus. If
            you are an adrenaline junkie and want to spice up your stay, there
            are too many trails with steep slopes and amazing mountain and sea
            views for you to choose.

            Although Taiwan is a tropical island, you still can find glacier
            traces on some mountain summits above 3,000-meter/9,842-foot sea
            level on Mt. Xue (3,886 m) or Mt. Nanhu (3,740 m). Or, if you just
            want to have a short getaway to have a relaxing roaming, it’s even
            closer than you could imagine.

            If you are lucky enough, you can wittiness the most magnificent sea

            to go far away or take a very challenging hike. You can see the
            views on Mt. Qixing (1,120 m), the highest mountain in Taipei City,
            or go further south to
            <a href="https://www.ali-nsa.net/en" target="_blank">Mt. Ali</a>, if
            the timing and weather are right. It's really difficult to describe
            how you feel when you see the sea of clouds flowing underneath your
            feet. When you get to see this, most people’s first reaction is
            “Wow” and are in awe of Mother Nature. And you will totally forget
            how difficult it is to get up there.

            There are all kinds of trails with different difficulty ratings for
            you to choose. Some trails can even allow you to decide you want to
            take the easy part, the difficult part or all of them, for example,
            the Mt. Teapot Trail (article link). If you have young children,
            many trails are family friendly and small children can easily enjoy
            the hike.

            Since Taiwan is a small island, many trails allow you to enjoy the
            magnificent mountain and ocean views at the same time. Some trails
            are very steep and require hikers to have a strong biceps because
            you have to grab the rope or tree roots to get yourself up or down.
            Some parts of the trails are on the narrow ridges and it can be very
            scary to walk on them. Some are covered with barren rocks and you
            can see the deep valley down below. If you are not afraid of height,
            those trails will be great to explore. (Read more:

            Other than the nature, some trails have stories behind them. Since
            the history of Taiwan can be traced back to several hundreds of
            years ago, some old trails were made for porters to transport goods
            during that time. Although many are replaced by modern highways, you
            still can find the relics in the woods. Local governments maintain

            In summer, we like to hike at higher attitudes to avoid the heat.
            Summer is also a good time to hike the 100 Peaks, because you can
            bring less gear. It might rain often, and it still rains due to
            orographic precipitation even the weather forecast says the chance
            of rain is low. Therefore, it’s important to prepare a raincoat with
            you when hiking. For local hikers who hike on a regular basis, it's
            normal to hike in the rain.
