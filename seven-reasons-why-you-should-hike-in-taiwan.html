            1. A wide variety of landscapes: from active volcanos to possible
            glacier traces

            Taiwan not only has many mountains but also has a wide range of
            terrains. If you want to experience volcanos with smoke from
            craters, you got it. You want to explore the lush jungles with water
            falls like Tarzan? We’ve got plenty. If you are an adrenaline junkie
            and want to spice up your stay, there are too many trails with steep
            slopes and amazing mountain and sea views for you to choose.
            Although Taiwan is a tropical island, you still can find glacier
            traces on some mountain summits above 3,000-meter sea level. Or, if
            you just want to have a short getaway to have a relaxing roaming,
            it’s even closer than you could imagine.

            As a result, it’s not surprising to know that the hiking activities
            are popular here. We have many registered hiking clubs and they
            organize many free hiking trips on the weekends. Some hold events
            during weekdays. For most of the hikes, you can just show up on time
            at the meeting points, meet new people or acquaintances, and enjoy
            the hike. If you opt to multi-day adventures, for a reasonable
            amount of money, you can just sign up and those hiking clubs will
            take care of mountain cabin or campsite applications, which is
            totally hassle free. (Read more:

            One of the unique things about those hiking clubs in Taiwan is the
            average age of the hikers is probably in mid 50 years old or older,
            so called boomers, quite the opposite compared to other countries.
            Many of them are experienced hikers and even have finished
            <a href="#" target="_blank">100 Three-thousanders</a> in Taiwan and
            it's even difficult for younger people to keep up with their pace.
            They are also very welcoming. Some of them even prepare extra trail
            foods, like fresh fruit, iced drinks, etc., which is a big delight
            on the trail. Some of the hikers speak English, so you don’t have to
            worry that it’s difficult to communicate with local hikers. When you
            are on the trails, you will see many trail marks on the tree trunks,
            those are tied by those hiking clubs for hikers to recognize the
            trails.

            Just like trails around the world, there are all kinds of trails
            labeled from being easy to very difficult. There are also many
            family friendly trails and small children can easily enjoy the hike.
            Some trails even allow you to enjoy the magnificent mountain and
            ocean views at the same time. Some trails are very steep and require
            hikers to have a strong biceps because you have to grab the rope or
            tree roots to get yourself up or down. Some parts of the trails are
            on the narrow ridges and it can be very scary to walk on them. Some
            are barren rocks and you can see the deep valley down below. If you
            are not afraid of height, those trails will be great to explore.

            Since the history of Taiwan can be traced back to hundreds of years
            ago, there were many main trails for porters to transport goods
            during that time. Although many are replaced by modern highways, you
            still can find the relics in the woods. Local governments maintain
            many

            As long as there are no typhoons or heavy rains, you can go hiking
            whenever you are available, as long as you follow

            and apply for your stay in advance. In summer, we like to hike at
            higher attitudes in summer to avoid the heat. Summer is also good
            for hiking Three-thousanders, because you don't have to bring too
            much gear for the snow. For hikers who hike on a regular basis, it's
            normal to hike in the rain. As long as you have proper clothing and
            gear to keep you warm and backpack dry, it's not that bad to hike in
            a small rain. For people who like water activities, it is very easy
            to find creeks, waterfalls, or lakes along the trails. You can also
            find several lakes above 3,000m/9842ft from the sea level in Taiwan.

            Other than hiking, you can also go camping, scuba diving, surfing,
            rafting, river trekking, bouldering, kayaking, para-gliding, hot air

            all kinds of registered clubs or companies to enjoy those adventures
            with qualified guides. Since Taiwan is small, it’s even better and
            more convenient for adventure junkies to experience as

            Last but not least,<a href="https://eng.taiwan.net.tw/m1.aspx?sNo=0002026" target="_blank">the food</a>. Many breakfast restaurants (it's
            literally translated from Chinese) open as early as 5am or run
            business 24 hours, so you can stop by to buy foods for your
            breakfast and lunch. I usually buy Fan Tuan, which is made of sticky
            rice with some fillings like fried bread sticks and pork floss, or
            vegetarian ingredients. Fan Tuan is very fulfilling and easy to
            carry during the hike. Or you can bring Ramen with you, and ask
            whether the guides can help you boil hot water. In Taiwan, Ramen is
            not just for broke students. Some expensive ones are with a small
            meat package inside. You can find all kinds of Ramen products at the
            supermarkets, luxuries, cheap, Taiwanese brands, or brands from
            South Asia, South Korea, or Japan.

            If you are still not sure, there are convenience stores everywhere
            and you can get bread, Ramen, hot foods, snacks, drinks etc. for
            your trail food. As to the post hiking meals, as long as you can
            reach any MRT station in Taipei, it's very easy to get to the famous
            food attractions. Furthermore, you don't have to go to ShiLin night
            market to enjoy the food, there are usually many restaurants near
            big MRT stations. Most noodle restaurants serve beef noodle soups.
            There are also many vegetarian restaurants. As to my favorite post
            hiking meals, they are fried chicken and bubble tea (boba). Those
            things are almost everywhere in Taiwan.
