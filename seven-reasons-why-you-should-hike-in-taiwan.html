          1. A Wide Variety of Landscapes: from Post-volcanic Landscape to
          Possible Glacier Traces
        </h3>
        <div class="article__content">
          70% of the area in Taiwan is covered by mountains, and there is a wide
          range of terrains. If you want to experience post-volcanic activities
          and see the craters still spewing smoke, it’s in Taipei City. If you
          prefer to explore the lush jungles with waterfalls, you have several
          places to see and you can get there by train or bus. If you are an
          adrenaline junkie and want to spice up your stay, there are too many
          trails with steep slopes and amazing mountain and sea views for you to
          choose.
          <br />
          Although Taiwan is a tropical island, you still can find glacier
          traces on some mountain summits above 3,000-meter/9,842-foot sea level
          on Mt. Xue (3,886 m) or Mt. Nanhu (3,740 m). Or, if you just want to
          have a short getaway to have a relaxing roaming, it’s even closer than
          you could imagine.
          <br />
          If you are lucky enough, you can wittiness the most magnificent sea of
          clouds in Taiwan. To enjoy those stunning views, you don’t have to go
          far away or take a very challenging hike. You can see the views on Mt.
          Qixing (1,120 m), the highest mountain in Taipei City, or go further
          south to
          <a href="https://www.ali-nsa.net/en" target="_blank">Mt. Ali</a>, if
          the timing and weather are right. It's really difficult to describe
          how you feel when you see the sea of clouds flowing underneath your
          feet. When you get to see this, most people’s first reaction is “Wow”
          and are in awe of Mother Nature. And you will totally forget how
          difficult it is to get up there.

          2. Enjoy Free-guided Hikes with Super Inviting and Friendly Local
          Hiking Communities
        </h3>
        <div class="article__content">
          Because of the special landscape, hiking activities are thriving and
          there are many registered hiking associations that offer free guided
          trips almost everyday, and you have more options on the weekends. For
          most of the hikes, you can just show up on time at the meeting points,
          meet new people, and enjoy the hike.
          <br />
          If you opt to multi-day adventures, for a reasonable amount of money,
          you can just sign up and those hiking associations will take care of
          the application process of mountain cabins or campsites and
          transportation, which is totally hassle free. (Read more:
          <a href="#" target="_blank">4 ways to enjoy hiking in Taiwan</a>)
          <br />
          The average age of hikers in Taiwan is relatively older than other
          countries, and the female hikers take the majority. Many of them are
          experienced hikers and even have finished hiking
          <a href="#" target="_blank">the 100 Peaks</a> in Taiwan and sometimes
          it's difficult for younger people to keep up with their pace.
          <br />
          They are also very welcoming and friendly, and will take care of you.
          Some of them even prepare extra trail foods, like fresh fruit, iced
          drinks, etc., which is a big delight on the trail. Some of the hikers
          speak English, so you don’t have to worry that it’s difficult to
          communicate with local hikers.

          4. All Kinds of Trails to Meet Your Hiking Buds: from Easy Roaming to
          Challenging Ones
        </h3>
        <div class="article__content">
          There are all kinds of trails with different difficulty ratings for
          you to choose. Some trails can even allow you to decide you want to
          take the easy part, the difficult part or all of them, for example,
          the Mt. Teapot Trail (article link). If you have young children, many
          trails are family friendly and small children can easily enjoy the
          hike.
          <br />
          Since Taiwan is a small island, many trails allow you to enjoy the
          magnificent mountain and ocean views at the same time. Some trails are
          very steep and require hikers to have a strong biceps because you have
          to grab the rope or tree roots to get yourself up or down. Some parts
          of the trails are on the narrow ridges and it can be very scary to
          walk on them. Some are covered with barren rocks and you can see the
          deep valley down below. If you are not afraid of height, those trails
          will be great to explore. (Read more:

          <br />
          Other than the nature, some trails have stories behind them. Since the
          history of Taiwan can be traced back to several hundreds of years ago,
          some old trails were made for porters to transport goods during that
          time. Although many are replaced by modern highways, you still can
          find the relics in the woods. Local governments maintain many

          available.
          <br />
          In summer, we like to hike at higher attitudes to avoid the heat.
          Summer is also a good time to hike the 100 Peaks, because you can
          bring less gear. It might rain often, and it still rains due to
          orographic precipitation even the weather forecast says the chance of
          rain is low. Therefore, it’s important to prepare a raincoat with you
          when hiking. For local hikers who hike on a regular basis, it's normal
          to hike in the rain.
          <br />
          For people who like water activities, it is very easy to find creeks,
          rivers, waterfalls, or lakes along the trails. You can also find
          several high elevation lakes above in Taiwan. For example, hike to

          7. Wonderful Foods for Breakfast, Lunch and Post-hiking Meals
        </h3>
        <div class="article__content">
          Last but not least,
          <a
            href="https://eng.taiwan.net.tw/m1.aspx?sNo=0002026"
            target="_blank"
            >the food</a
          >. Many breakfast restaurants (it's literally translated from Chinese,
          早餐店) open as early as 5 am or run business 24 hours, so you can
          stop by to buy foods for your breakfast and lunch.
          <br />
          I usually buy Fan Tuan, which is made of sticky rice with some
          fillings like fried bread sticks and pork floss, or vegetarian
          ingredients. Fan Tuan is very fulfilling and easy to carry during the
          hike. Or you can bring Ramen and ask whether the guides can help you
          boil water.
          <br />
          In Taiwan, Ramen is not just for broke college students. Some
          expensive ones are with a small meat package inside. You can find all
          kinds of Ramen products at the supermarkets, for example, luxury or
          cheap ones, Taiwanese brands, or brands from South Asia, South Korea,
          or Japan.
          <br />
          If you are still not sure, there are convenience stores everywhere and
          you can get bread, Ramen, hot foods, snacks, drinks etc. for your
          trail food. As to the post hiking meals, as long as you can reach any
          MRT station in Taipei, it's very easy to get to the famous
          restaurants.
          <br />
          Furthermore, you don't have to go to Shilin Night Market to enjoy the
          food, there are usually many restaurants near big MRT stations. Most
          noodle restaurants serve beef noodle soups if you want to try. There
          are also many vegetarian restaurants. As to my favorite post hiking
          meals, they are fried chicken and bubble tea (boba). Those things are
          almost everywhere in Taiwan.
