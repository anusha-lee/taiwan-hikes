            Taipei City is a basin sounded by hills and mountains. For visitors
            who want to go hiking in Taipei, Mt. Qixing and Mt. Elephant (or Mt.
            Xiang) trails are probably the most popular options. You will see
            wonderful city views from the summit of both trails. But, if you
            want to see something totally different, you definitely have to hike
            Mt. Teapot, Mt. Banping, and Mt. Canguanliao trails.

            If you still want to explore more, you can exit from the other side
            of Mt. Teapot and you will see a steep slope going down. After
            getting down the slope, turn left and you will see Mt. Banping
            ahead.

            There is a trail on the left, which will lead to another trail and
            different trail end. I’ve been to this trail several times and it’s
            very slippery to get down, and the descending is huge. Luckily, it’s
            not easy to tell where the detour is so I don’t think you will pick
            up the wrong one.

            become steeper. There are ropes on the trails. When you get here,
            the views opened up. You will see layers of hills, some are natural,
            and some are man-made, because this area used to be mines many years

            There are actually two trailheads to Mt. Keelung, and the one with endless stone steps is the easy one. If you’ve taken the previous trail, I would suggest you to take the stone-step one, because the other trail is much more difficult than trails to Mt. Teapot, Mt. Banping, and Mt. Canguanliao, and there are several really steep bare-rock slopes, and I wouldn’t recommend you to hike there alone. There’s a Class 3 Triangulation Stone on the summit of Mt. Keelung and the views are wonderful, too.
