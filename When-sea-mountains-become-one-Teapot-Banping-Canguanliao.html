            Taipei City is a basin sounded by hills and mountains. For visitors
            who want to go hiking in Taipei, Mt. Qixing and Mt. Elephant (or Mt.
            Xiang) trails are probably the most popular options. You will see
            wonderful city views from the summit of both trails. But, if you
            want to see something totally different, you definitely have to hike
            Mt. Teapot, Mt. Banping, and Mt. Canguanliao trails.

            After getting off at Quanji Temple, you can turn to the parking lot.
            There's a platform close to the parking lot when you go in further.
            Right here, you can see the 陰陽海 Yingyang Sea. If you just want to
            stop here to enjoy the view, it’s totally fine. But there will be

            stone steps. Please don’t get put off by those steps. I hike
            regularly, but I still don’t like stone steps. Starting here, just
            follow the stone steps, and there are platforms and pavilions to
            take a small break. After a platform, the stone steps disappear and
            are replaced by rocks. Just continue, and you will get to see the
            last pavilion before Mt. Teapot. You can take a breath, soaking the
            mountain and sea views here before you head to Mt. Teapot.

            From the pavilion, Mt. Teapot looks like a pile of rocks. If you are
            not comfortable with height, please stop here. The view from Mt.
            Teapot is great enough. If you want to climb inside, please make
            sure you have a pair of cotton yarn gloves with you. It takes some
            effort to get inside the caves. Watch out your head because the
            passage inside the caves is very narrow and you will bump your head
            against the rocks. Before you want to grab the rope, please make
            sure the rope is strong enough to hold your weight. It's very dark
            inside the caves, and there are big gaps between each step.

            injured badly. Once you finish, you can take the same caves back,

            If you still want to explore more, you can exit from the other side
            of Mt. Teapot and you will see a steep slope going down. After
            getting down the slope, turn left and you will see Mt. Banping
            ahead. There is a trail on the left, which will lead to another
            trail and different trail end. I’ve been to this trail several times
            and it’s very slippery to get down, and the descending is huge.
            Luckily, it’s not easy to tell where the detour is so I don’t think
            you will pick up the wrong one.

            The trail condition is a little bit rough and can be slippery

            almost all the way up, but don’t forget to turn around and see the
            views behind you. At this moment, Mt. Teapot is quite far behind
            you.

            steep barren slope. When I got there, I was a little bit taken back.
            I have fear of height, and I was on my own. After a closer look, I
            saw there was a rope, Via Ferrata, and carved foot holes, thinking
            this should be Okay. It turned out it was. The slope’s bark looked
            worse than its bite, but you still have to proceed with caution.

            4. The Translations on The Trails Can be Confusing and Funny
          </h3>

          <div class="article__section--content">
            As a local, our translation system confuses me, too. So, I can
            totally understand how frustrated the international visitors feel
            and wonder how they can survive when they are here. According to the
            website of our Bureau of Consular Affairs, Ministry of Foreign
            Affairs, you might get up to 4 different English pronunciations when
            you type one Chinese phrase. For example, the translations on Mt.
            Xue, 雪山. I've seen both Mt. Xue and Syue Mountain on the trail,
            not to mention Mt. Snow, which is literally translated from Chinese.
            When you hike the highest peak in Taipei City, you will see the post
            on the peak says Mt. Cishing, instead of Mt. Qixing. As the popular
            hike to Mt. Teapot (add link), you will also see Cha Hu Shan, or Cha
            Hu Mountain, and the official Chinese name is 無耳茶壺山.

            the indicators of whether you will see the views. There are three
            main classes of those stones in Taiwan: Class 1 Triangulation Stones
            usually mean you can see the vest views on the summits, but
            sometimes those Triangulation Stones are placed in the woods and
            there is no view to see. There are five Class 1 Triangulation Stones
            in Taipei City and New Taipei City, but you can only get a great
            view from three of them. The highest peak in Taipei City, Mt.
            Qixing, 1,120 meters (3,675 feet), also has a Class 1 Triangulation
            Stone. Not every summit will have those stones. Triangulation Stones
            are for geodetic surveying.

            Some hikers say touching those stones will make your hike easier. Of

            going and show respect the mountains. There are some hand-made signs

            When you hike on Suburban Mountain Trails (not those maintained by
            governments with stone steps), the most common terrains are tangled
            tree roots or dirt trails covered by grasses or bamboo woods. Many
            hiking associations will tie bright-colored plastic ribbons on the

            Some local hiking associations will screen hikers’ physical
            conditions or their hiking experience for certain trails. However,
            there is also a gap between self-assessment and the reality. Every
            outdoor activity is different. Being good at running marathons
            doesn’t mean you will be fine with a long hike. I've met some new
            hikers (me included) who have exercise habits thought they could
            take on the more difficult hikes, but it turns out the trail is too
            much for them. We all misjudge sometimes, which is fine. If you
            think the trail is too much for you, please don’t feel embarrassed
            to let the guides know. Ask for help whenever you need, you and
            fellow hikers will thank you later.

            Another thing is the fear of height, or acrophobia. Sometimes, we
            have to hike through the thin bare ridges or climb the steep slopes
            with the ropes. If there are trees along those ridges or slopes,
            things will not be too bad if you try not to look down. The worse
            situation is there is nothing on the rocks to block your imagination
            of slipping on the rock and fall to your death.

            Usually, the hiking associations will give you the warning in

            it didn’t go well. I knew some parts of the trail might trigger the
            fear of height, but I didn’t expect the slopes were so steep and
            there were almost no edges to put my feet. I still made it back, but
            it was really scary. Luckily, I saw one of the most fantastic views
            I've ever seen and that gave me some comfort. If you are not sure,
            you can always check with the guides to make sure this trail is for
            you.

            I watch many YouTube videos about hikes on Pacific Crest Trail or
            Appalachian Trail, and the hikers seldom wear hiking boots on those
            long trails. They wear light weight trail shoes or running shoes. In
            Taiwan, this kind of footwear is not suitable and will make your
            miserable if you hike on the difficult terrains. Rainboots are bulky
            and heavy, and I have to say I’m not a big fan of them, but I still
            wear them on the trails. Before my hike, I will Google to see the
            trail condition to decide what I’m going to wear. Most of time, I
            just wear rainboots.

            It’s very easy to clean. Many trails locate in the mountains with
            the most precipitation in Taiwan. The muds there will never dry, no
            matter how hot or sunny it is. Some mud is so thick and sticky that
            your rainboots will get stuck in the mud when you walk into it.
            After a long day hike, the last thing you want to do is to clean up
            the dried mud on your hiking boots. As to rainboots, it’s so easy to
            clean up.

            Rainboots are very cheap. It cost around USD 10 to buy one pair.
            However, we wear more than just a pair of rainboots, but also wear
            ankle braces and at least two layers of insoles to protect our feet.
            To be honest, the cost of my insoles can allow me to buy at least 7
            pairs of rainboots, not to mention the cost of ankles braces. The
            overall cost is still cheaper than regular hiking boots.

            The weather is humid, and the landscape is like jungles, which is a
            perfect home for leeches, especially after raining. Wearing long
            sleeves and pants doesn’t totally protect you from being bitten by
            leeches, but it can at least give those blood suckers some hard time
            to attach to your bare skin.

            and usually won’t give you bad reactions, and it’s very easy to get
            rid of them once they lay their suckers on your skin. Just a pinch
            of salt and they will drop right away. I tried to use my fingers to
            pull them away from my skin, but they stuck on my fingertip instead.

            cabins and campsites on those areas and hikers must apply for

            Sometimes hikers can camp on elementary school campus, but not every

            If the trails locate in other counties, many hiking associations
            will hire buses for the hikers or arrange carpool. Hikers pay the
            fee first when signing up. Some are one-day trips, and others are
            usually multi-day hikes. Hikers need show up on time at the meeting
            points and you can take a nap on the bus, bring extra clothing and
            leave them on the bus during your hike. The hikers who take those
            trips are also insured by the bus companies. I joined a hike like
            this a while ago and met some foreign hikers hoping to get a
            hitchhike. The driver didn’t take them because according to the
            driver, the bus company had to take responsibility if accidents
            happened. So, I guess if you want to hitchhike, you probably will
            have to ask for private cars or wait patiently for the bus to come.

            Expect crowds and noise on the trials. Most of the hiking
            associations don’t set up a maximum number of hikers to join their
            hikes. Many people may show up if the weather is perfect. Sometimes,
            there might be even 100 or more hikers showing up. When it gets
            crowded on the trail, please remember to keep a certain distance
            from hiker in front of you if she or he uses trekking poles and keep
            yours near you as much as you can.

            You might find ropes on some steep slopes, but it can be difficult
            to use the ropes if the hikers behind you also grab the rope at the
            same time. I usually try to grab tree roots, pointed rocks, or
            strong grass if I climb steep slopes and avoid the rope as much as I
            can. Check to see whether the ropes are strong enough to hold your
            weight.

            Since the hiking groups can be very big, hikers in Taiwan have
            established a habit to inform those behind them about the trail
            condition ahead. For example, most hikers will say Xiǎo xīn tóu
            小心頭 ‘watch out your head’ if there are low branches, or Xiǎo xīn
            jiǎo 小心腳 ’watch out your feet’ if there are holes or big tree
            roots on the trails. This can prevent some injuries and it hurts so
            much to bump your head into the low branches. I’ve seen some serious
            cut on hikers’ heads when they accidently bump into the trees.

            your hotel on time, they can ask for help on your behalf. In the
            mountains, it’s difficult to find the phone signals, unless you have
            a satellite phone with you, which is unlikely.

            If you decide to hike alone, please at least bring a whistle with

            even though you think the trail you pick is very easy, but sometimes
            they might be more difficult than you could have imagined. It’s even
            better if you can write a hiking trip plan and give it to people
            before you start your hike.

            Taiwanese are heavy Facebook Groups and Line users. Line is like

            and Line to share the latest trips and photos and connect with
            members. If things come up or they must cancel the trips, they
            usually announce through Facebook. Some will send emails.

            15. Last but not Least, Always Have a Plan B
          </h3>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            The weather casts a major influence on whether you can hike or not.
            It's normal to have trips canceled or postponed due to the sudden
            weather change. For local hikers, this might be easy to solve. We
            just stay home. However, for international hikers, if your main goal
            is to hike the 100 Peaks, the sudden cancellation can be very
            frustrating. But safety first. All hiking trips will be canceled if
            the Central Weather Bureau in Taiwan issues typhoon alerts. If you
            still insist to go (if, surprisingly, the guide also agrees), it’s
            not fun to hike in a bad weather. You potentially put yourself and
            others in danger. I know you may not visit Taiwan again after this
            trip, which I hope you will, but there are still many things for you
            to enjoy during your stay if the weather is not in your favor.
            Always have a plan B, and this won’t hurt.
