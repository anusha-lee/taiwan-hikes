            This is my second time to hike Qilai Nanhua but my first time to plan a 100 Peaks trip, apply for permits, arrange transport and coordinate other things from scratch. All those things contribute to this guide. I went with a group on my first hike, but I enjoy much more during my second one, mainly because of my wonderful hiking mates.

            Qilai Nanhua is one of the entry-level hikes among 100 Peaks. Because this trail is easy and there’s a good accommodation with meals and sleeping bags to rent, this trail is very popular among hikers (or even non hikers) in Taiwan. As you can imagine, it can be very crowded on the trail during the weekends or long holidays.

              There were 2 big earthquakes on April 18, 2021, and the quakes caused several sections of the trail collapsed, especially the first 3 km.

            During Japanese Occupation, Nenggao Cross-Ridge Trail was built to help them rule the indigenous tribes. At that time, Japanese colonial government also started establishing infrastructure and had established several power plants in Tongmen, Qingshui and other places in eastern Taiwan, which had produced more electricity than the eastern Taiwan needed. 
          </div>  
          <div class="article__section--content">
            Therefore, Japanese colonial government decided to transmit the excess electricity to western Taiwan during the late WWII. After WWII was over and Japan surrendered, Japan handed Taiwan over to Kuomintung, whose chairman was Chiang Kai-Shek. But this project of east-west power transmission was also brought to a halt due to the chaos and lack of funding.
          </div>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            To make the long story short, the government of United States of American decided to fund USD $400,000, which is equivalent in purchasing power to about $7.4 million today, designated to Taipower Company to carry on this electricity transmission project in 1950.

            Finally, this project was finished in 1953, and Taipower Company built a monument to commemorate this great achievement.

            By the way, if you like knifes or machetes, Tongmen Machetes 銅門刀 are very famous. It’s said when the Dutch occupied Taiwan in the 17 century, Truku people were very impressed by their machete making skills and exchanged deer antlers for the knowledge of making machetes, which has become a skill passed by generations among Truku people.

I’m not an expert to this, but you’ll have to let your hiking mates know whenever you feel weird, no matter how tiny those symptoms are. I had a cold before our trip and I was worried this might trigger altitude sickness, so I visited my doctor before our hike and took some medicine. There’s a famous doctor in Taiwan, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/doctor.on.the.mountain/" class="post-link-style" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dr. Wang 王士豪醫生</a>, whose specialties are treating high altitude sickness and other illness related to high altitude hiking.

            Where I first visited Yuanhai Line Station, there was no toilet. We had to relieve ourselves in the back of the office. Unfortunately, you would see lousy things left behind by lousy hikers. I’ll spare the details here. It's good that there are toilets now, but sometimes the toilets didn’t have enough water. So, be prepared for something not so pleasant.

            After we resumed our hike, we started seeing clouds spilling over the ridges in the distance. Then, we reached the most dangerous section of this trail, the unstable rock slope at 5.9 km. To be honest, this slope was easy to pass, but the problem is you don’t know when the falling rocks decide to land and land on your head. So, please pass this area as soon as possible. It was close to 3 pm when we went through this area.

            I knew it was inevitable that we had to hike in the dark. Then, I decided to accept it and tried to relax. The trail was very easy to hike and we all had headlamps. Hiking here in the dark was not a big deal. It was just we couldn’t see Tianchi Lodge and the powerline near Kuang Pei Pa Piao Monument from the trail.

            From there, it was all stairs and all the way up, very easy to follow. While we were taking our time waiting for our hiking mates to catch up, we suddenly saw a tiny head with two reflective eyes sticking out of the gutter. It turned out that was a golden weasel. I think this fellow was very curious about us, so it sticked out its head at least three times from the gutter, which reminded me of the game, Whack A Mole. It was pity that when I tried to take a photo of it, it was already gone.

            It was so cold that my nose was running all the time. And the slope became steeper, too. There were no stairs after Tian Pond and the trail terrain was more rugged, but still manageable.

            Finally, we reached Mt. Qilai South Peak. Before we arrived there, we still could see stars in the sky. However, when we got there, it became so cloudy that we didn’t see any amazing sunrise at all. We let the big group take photos first. After they left, we took our time to take some photos. We were disappointed by not seeing the amazing sunrise, but this is normal when you go hiking.

            Soon after leaving the lodge, we crossed No. 4 Suspension Bridge. I didn’t remember crossing the bridge on the previous day because it was too dark. Fangyi suggested us to visit Nenggao Waterfall aka Sandie Waterfall 能高瀑布 or 三疊瀑布, so we decided to take a detour to explore, which turned out to be a great decision.

            When we went further, I looked at the mountains on the other side again, and I got what I was looking for. During my first visit, our guide told us that we could see the powerline near Kuang Pei Pa Piao Monument. I saw it again this time. When you visit, remember to look for the powerline when you reach around 12k mark.

            Thoughts about This Hike: How to Improve Your Hiking Experience
          </h3>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            When I first hiked this trail in March 2019, I told my then hiking mate that it was possible to do this hike by yourself without going with a group. I’m very happy to test it out. If you don’t have enough people to share the cost of hiring a car, you still can take the public transport to Malan B&amp;B and they also provide the ride to the trailhead. 
          </div>  
          <div class="article__section--content">
            If you are not a regular hiker, I strongly suggest you do some training once you decide to go. I told Walt to carry a backpack with at least 5 liters of water bottles and take the stairs to his apartment on the 13th floor. It was boring, but it helped.

            Prepare at least 2 Nights and 2 Days for This Hike
          </h4>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            As to the itinerary, doing this hike for 2 nights and 2 days will be easier if you are not a fast hiker. If you stay the hotel nearby, like <a href="https://www.facebook.com/PuWaLun/" class="post-link-style" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Malan B&amp;B</a> with the pickup service, you can start hiking in the morning and take your time to Tianchi Lodge.

            Some hikers even went further up to Mt. Qilai South Peak to see sunset on their first day of hike, and see the sunrise again on the next day.

          <div class="article__section--content">            
            But just because we started late, we were able to see the most stunning sunset glow through the woods and mountains. Who knows? No matter how often you have hiked the same trails, they always can surprise you and let you find something totally new.

It was almost flat from Tianchi Lodge to the monument and the round trip is 4 km long and takes around 2 hours.

            Safety First: A Tragic Accident Happened after Our Hike
          </h4>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            Although this trail is considered safe even for the beginners, there are still risks during the hike. Not long after we finished our hike, we heard a very sad news that <a href="https://news.ltn.com.tw/news/society/breakingnews/3377866" class="post-link-style" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a worker who was helping transport materials for hikers fell off the slope and sadly died</a>.

            Now, hikers will have to take the detour instead of Tunyuan Trailhead. It is safer but also longer. I haven't got a chance to try the detour, but I was told that it is more challenging than the old 3km hike.

I promise you won’t regret.
