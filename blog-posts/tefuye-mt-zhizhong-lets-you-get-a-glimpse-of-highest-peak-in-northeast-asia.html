            Mt. Zhizhong used to be named after the fourth of Japanese Governor-General 總督, Kodama Gentaro 兒玉源太郎, called Mt. Eryu. Later, President Chiang Kai-shek changed the name after General Zhang Zhizhong, who fought hard during the Second Sino-Japanese War. Aside from the history, the peak of Mt. Zhizhong is a great place to see Mt. Yu ridgeline.

There are many tall Japanese Cedar Threes here. Walking on the old rail track and being surrounded by those tall beautiful trees is very relaxing.

            The first thing caught my eye was the layers of mountains in the
            valley. Our guide told us this was a great spot to see the beautiful
            sunrise if you camp nearby. If the clear sky and the mountains we
            witnessed at that moment was already astonishing, I couldn’t imagine
            how stunning it would be if I could get a chance to see the sunrise.

            decide to take this trail: this trail is considered as a high altitude hike, and the high altitude will make the breathing a little bit more difficult if you aren't used to it.

            I learned this lesson in the hard way during this hike. Our group left
            Taipei late on the previous evening, and by the time we got to our B&B, it was 1 am already.
            We had to get up at 5 am, which means we only had less than 4 hours
            to sleep. But sometimes your sacrifice will pay off. When we were
            about to leave our B&B, i realized we were surrounded by mountains
            and Mt. Yu was one of them.

            While hiking on the trail and enjoying the beautiful trees, I noticed
            some big trees were brutally chopped down and there were signs on
            them. I went up close to check out those signs. The signs said those
            trees were the victims of illegal logging, and those crimes were
            under investigation. This wasn't my first time seeing this. Illegal
            logging is still a serious issue in Taiwan. The government promises
            they will relax the restrictions on hiking in Taiwan and encourage
            hikers to report poachers if seeing them. I truly hope this will help reduce illegal logging.

            I will do this hike again, but I will also change the

            First, I will leave Taipei earlier if possible. We left Taipei
            around 8 pm and we arrived at our B&B around 1 am, which took us
            around 6 hours to Alishan area.

            Second, I will camp at old Zhizhong Police Station, a red building next to the Tefuye trailhead, to reduce the
            commuting time. Sorry I didn't take the photo. The policemen no long station here. Some hikers camp here to save time. It took us almost 2 hours from our B&B to Tefuye Old
            Trail. If we could camp there, we could have slept
            more and even seen the sunrise. Our guides arranged B&B for us hoping that we
            could sleep better, but we could only sleep around 4 hours, which
            didn’t help much.

            Third, I probably will skip Mt. Beixia, make it a point-to-point
            route, and take the same route back to where we stared, and spend
            more time to enjoy Tefuye Old Trail.

            Fourth, during our hike, I saw many maple leaves on the trail, and
            the color was still amazing. If you enjoy seeing the rare fall foliage in Taiwan, I
            think you can arrange this hike in autumn.
