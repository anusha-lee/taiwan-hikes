            ROMA is actually a short name of the ridge between two summits: Mt. Luoyewei, 2,717 meters (8,914 feet) and Mt. Mawuzuye, 2,368 meters (7,769 feet). It’s nothing to do with Roma Italy. We take the first word from those trail names to make this trail easy to remember.

            The trail isn’t long, but you need to hike from elevation of 1,810 meters to 2,717 meters. Once you get to the peaks, you will be surrounded by two beautiful ridgelines with the most famous 100 Peaks and the sea of clouds in Taiwan. When I hiked there in December 2019, I was lucky enough to see snow-capped summits and rimes.

            We stayed at nearby B&B, but many hikers choose to wildcamping near the trailhead at Yousheng River 有勝溪. To get to our first peak, Mt. Luoyewei, we needed to cross the river first. Therefore, prepare some extra socks or another pair of shoes to prevent your hiking boots from getting wet. I wore rainboots so it was easy for me.

            Before we started our hike, it had been raining and cold for days, but the weather forecast said we would have a good weather. To be honest, I didn’t believe it because when we arrived at the trailhead, it was still cloudy and grey. We saw trees and branches covered by ice, caused by rain and the extremely cold temperature. It even had been snowing on Mt. Xue for a few days. So, it was icy and cold on the trail.

            After lunch, the section of the trail was easier than the previous ones. It was still steep, but the terrain was mostly covered by leaves and pine needles, and there were many majestic big trees with huge branches reaching out along the trail.

            There were several old trees here. The ferns and moss on the branches were like little fairies dancing among twigs and beams of sunlight, and those made us easily to lose track of time. Our guides urged us to go faster, because nobody wanted to hike in the dark if we stayed too long, and they promised us that there would be a big surprise waiting for us.

            Massive Descending with Silver Grass and Unexpected Sea of Clouds

            Silver grass is a very strong plant that can survive in harsh environments, and you can see it almost everywhere in Taiwan. After seeing two major mountain ranges, we made a turn and hiked through the silver grass. Those views on this grassland made me stop here to take as many photos as I could. When you hike here, please be aware of the big rocks hidden among the silver grass. It will hurt a lot or even break your toes if you accidentally kick them.

            Getting to the trailhead isn’t difficult. I will take the first bus of either Bus 1751 or 1764 and get off at Siyuan Police Station. Then, walk around 5 km to the other trailhead and camp there. Then do the hike from the other trailhead. Then, take it easy and enjoy the camping on the first day.

            Note: I found this beautiful image of Siyuan Yakou when it was very cold in late 2020. Not endorsing this company in any sort.

            However, it will be trickier to arrange your transport after the hike, because the last bus for you to catch at Siyuan Police Station is roughly at 14:40, which is impossible to finish the hike by then. It takes at least 10 hours to finish the hike. So, you might need to camp near Siyuan Police Station for another night and catch the first Bus 1751 back to Yilan Transfer Station at 9:40 the next morning.
          </div>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            In this case, you might need to prepare 3 days to hike this trail. This trail is great for all seasons, especially to avoid the heat in summer. If you can spare 3 days to do this hike in summer, camping near the trailhead might be a great idea. But please be cautious of the possible floods before you go.
