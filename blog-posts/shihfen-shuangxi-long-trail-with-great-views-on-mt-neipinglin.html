            Pingxi and Shuangxi are two districts in New Taipei City and next to each other. Both are also in the south of Ruifang. There are also many wonderful hiking trails in both districts and one of my favorite places to hike.

            Pinghu Recreation Area 平湖森林遊樂區 was built by Pingxi Township (now Pingxi District) in the last century, and it was meant to be a forest theme park to attract tourists. However, the business didn’t go as expected, and this area was devastated by several typhoons. Pingxi Township gradually gave it up and let it be free for the public to access.

            The name of the location of Pinghu Recreation Area is called Fanzikeng 番子坑. Keng in Chinese means valley. It is said that Taiwanese plains aborigines 平埔族 had lived in Fanzikeng during Jiaqing Emperor of Qing Dynasty. Therefore, the Han people who first immigrated here called this area Fanzikeng. Please note that Fanzi was used to refer to indigenous people and it is not a very friendly name. But, unfortunately we still can hear this nowadays.

            <span class="bold-style">Shihfen Train Station</span>: 十分火車站, a famous tourist attraction packed with tons of people and identical shops. I usually try to avoid taking the train here, because it will be like a battle to get on the carriage. <br />
            <span class="bold-style">Qianjieling or Qianjie Peak</span>: 千階嶺 meaning thousands of steps in Chinese, height 330 meters (1,083 feet). The view is great. <br />
            <span class="bold-style">Mt. Fanzikeng</span>: 番子坑山, height 476 meters (1,562 feet). I honestly think you can skip this one, but the round trip to this small peak is only 20 minutes. <br />
            <span class="bold-style">Mt. Neipinglin</span>: 內平林山, height 502 meters (1,647 feet). The highlight of this hike. You definitely have to visit this peak. There is a Class 3 Triangulation Stone on the peak. <br />
            <span class="bold-style">Mt. Dapinglin</span>: 大平林山, height 420 meters (1,378 feet). Not much to see here. <br />
            <span class="bold-style">Mt. Xinluwei</span>: 新路尾山, height 315 meters (1,033 feet). You can get some decent views here. <br />
            <span class="bold-style">Mt. Dazhulin</span>: 大竹林山, height 304 meters (997 feet). I missed this one, but it seems not much to see on the peak according to other hikers. <br />
            <span class="bold-style">Shuangxi Train Station</span>: 雙溪火車站. A quiet small time but much to my liking. This place is worth paying a visit even not for hiking.

Fortunately, there were interesting things to give me distraction, like this narrow gutter above a small creek. I’ve been wondering what the gutter was for.

            The only drawback is you will have to squeeze yourself into the carriage of Pingxi Line with other tourists, and you have to transfer your train at Ruifang Station.

After the deal was struck, General Turtle's spirit finally returned and his body turned into a stone statue staying there forever. That’s why it’s called Stone Turtle.
