            Pingxi and Shuangxi are two districts in New Taipei City and are next to each other. Both are also in the south of Ruifan. There are also many wonderful hiking trails in both districts and my favorite places to hike.

            Pinghu Recreation Area 平湖森林遊樂區 was built by Pingxi Township (now Pingxi District) in last century, and it was meant for forest theme park to attract tourists. However, the business didn’t go as expected, and this area was devastated by several typhoons. Pingxi Township gradually gave it up and let it be free for the public to access.

          <div class="article__section--content">
            The name of the location of Pinghu Recreation Area is called Fanzikeng. Keng in Chinese means valley. It is said that Taiwanese plains aborigines 平埔族 had lived in Fanzikeng during Jiaqing Emperor of Qing Dynasty. Therefore, the Han people who first immigrated here called this area Fangzikeng. Please note that Fangzi was used to refer to indigenous people and it is not a very friendly name. But, unfortunately we still can hear this nowadays.

            Those sections left from the theme park are Huangshan Road 環山道路, the East Trail (footpath) and the West Trail (the natural terrain). The East Trail is more friendly for people who don’t hike regularly.

            Pingxi used to be a coal town, and there is a famous Pingxi Railway Line with all kinds of tourist attractions to explore. Other than the culture and beautiful old buildings left from that era, Pingxi’s hilly terrain also has unique geological formations like potholes 壺穴 (the erosion caused by rivers or waterfalls) and waterfalls worth to visit. There are 36 waterfalls in Pingxi.

            No matter which trailhead you want to start, you can take <a href="https://tip.railway.gov.tw/tra-tip-web/tip?lang=EN_US" class="post-link-style" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Local Train</a> and get off at Shuangxi or Shihfen Train Station.

            Peaks to Reach
          </h3>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            <span class="bold-style">Shihfen Train Station</span>: 十分火車站, a famous tourist attraction packed with tons of people and identical shops. I usually try to avoid taking the train here, because it will be like a battle to get on the carriage. <br />
            <span class="bold-style">Qianjie Peak</span>: 千階嶺 meaning thousands of steps in Chinese, height 330 meters (1,083 feet). The view is great. <br />
            <span class="bold-style">Mt. Fanzikeng</span>: 番子坑山, height 476 meters (1,562 feet). I honestly think you can skip this one, but the round trip to this small peak is only 20 minutes. <br />
            <span class="bold-style">Mt. Neipinglin</span>: 內平林山, height 502 meters (1,647 feet). The highlight of this hike. You definitely have to visit this peak. There is a Class 3 Triangulation Stone on the peak. <br />
            <span class="bold-style">Mt. Dapinglin</span>: 大平林山, height 420 meters (1,378 feet). Not much view here. <br />
            <span class="bold-style">Mt. Xinluwei</span>: 新路尾山, height 315 meters (1,033 feet). You can see surrounding mountains here. <br />
            <span class="bold-style">Mt. Dazhulin</span>: 大竹林山, height 304 meters (997 feet). I missed this one, but it seems not much to see on the peak according to other hikers. <br />
            <span class="bold-style">Shuangxi Train Station</span>: 雙溪火車站. A quiet small time but much to my liking. This place is worth to pay a visit even not for hiking.

Many of them had posted that they just did Shuan-Shih Long Distance Hike, and the trail condition was extremely good, thanks to the efforts of a group of volunteer hikers 聯合探勘隊 and Blue Sky Team 藍天隊 to clean up the grass and tree branches. This is usually a cue for me to do my solo hike.

            Moreover, there are more restaurants that are still open in Shihfen after you finish your hike. When I finished my hike in Shuangxi, I was trying to find a restaurant, but all of them were closed. I was so hungry, and we weren’t allowed to eat on the trail due to the pandemic.

            According to the folklore, Xuantian Shandi 玄天上帝, a god, conquered a turtle and a snake and appointed them as generals in his imperial administration in his Qing Dynasty. However, General Snake wanted to take a break, so he sneaked into the human world and caused troubles. Therefore, Xuantian Shandi sent General Turtle to stop him. However, the battles with General Snake were so intense that General Turtle was too exhausted to get back to the court, and he was forced to rest by Qiankeng River. While he was going to die, the earth god showed up and negotiated with General Turtle that the earth god would help General Turtle’s spirit back to Xuantian Shandi’s court, but his body would stay in Qiankeng to protect the local people. General Turtle agreed and turned into a stone staying there forever. That’s why it’s called Stone Turtle. Shih means stone and gui means turtle in Chinese.
