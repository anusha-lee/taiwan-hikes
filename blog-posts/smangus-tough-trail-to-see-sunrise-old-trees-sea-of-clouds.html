            This campsite probably could accommodate 40 people. There was a

            guess I was still in shock after the scary sidehill and nothing much to
            see on the peak also put me off. So, the keeper guide and I got

            sidehill without much shade, but the scenery totally opened up with
            mountains circling the valley. Those mountains were the peaks on Holly Ridgeine Trail. Instead of the orange hue in the early morning, the
            Holly Ridgeline Trail stood there with the ocean blue sky in the
            background, hugging the valley and the sea of cotton-like white
            clouds above it. Our guide Acer knew that we wanted to
            savor this moment, so he let us take a break.

            descending on some wooden stairs and for some unknown reason he lost
            his footing and tilted to the slope. I was
            shocked by his sudden losing balance and squatted down trying to
            grab his backpack. But the distance between him and me was longer
            than my arm length, I could only barely pinch his backpack raincover and
            dragged his raincover to the left as much as I could. Surprisingly, he
            moved back to the left and regained his balance. We continued our
            hike.

            Later, I asked him what happened. He said he lost his footing. Then I
            asked him how he got his balance back. He told me “a move” in
            English. I asked again: Did you feel I was pinching your backpack
            raincover? He gave me a look mixed with realization and confusion. Anyway, he was safe, which is the most important thing.

            The third incident was that a girl who wore a helmet and hiking
            boots slipped off a log when we were trying to pass a gutter. She fell off about one meter and landed on her right side. I think her helmet prevented her from possible head injury. She was shocked but suffered no visible harm. Most of us wore rainboots. There's nothing wrong with wearing hiking boots, of course, but it’s easier to hike in Taiwan with the rainboots. Luckily, she was doing okay.

            If you can arrange a transportation, Smangus is a great delight to
            visit, whether you take the easy strolling or the challenging trail
            all the way to Qilan, Yilan. If I want to take the easy trail, I
            will stay at least 2 days to enjoy this peaceful indigenous village,
            taking my time and absorbing the fresh air.

            If you opt for adventures, the trail from Smangus to Qilan will
            certainly not disappoint you. But there are many forks on this
            trail, I don’t recommend you do it alone. It's better to hire an
            experienced local guide to take you there. Going with a group might
            be a good option because you don’t have to worry about driving or
            hiring a car.

            slopes, but also the treacherous terrains. As I said, there are
            dangers on some parts of the trail. Please be cautious when you

            Overall, we were very lucky to stay safe and enjoyed a lot. We saw
            the most amazing views and see the mystic virgin woods. I highly
            recommend people who are fit and not afraid of height to take on the
            point-to-point trail, and to hike it with experienced guides. If you
            ask me whether I want to hike it again, to be honest, the easy one
            to see the old trees? That’s for sure. The one from Smangus to
            Qilan? Uh... maybe once is enough. But who knows?
