            After doing group hikes in Taiwan for a while, you will have a list of favorite guides and you will sign up their trips no matter where they are going. This is one of them. Xiao Tsai 小蔡 is one of my favorite guides from <a href="http://www.loho.org.tw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="post-link-style">LOHAS</a>, and his trips are quite challenging. If you want to upgrade your hiking experience, Xiao Tsai’s trips are definitely worth to consider. But please bear in mind that most of his trips are quite tough. It's better to get prepared before you sign up.

            Another benefit to hike with a group is you get to hike in remote places if you don’t drive. Even if you have a car, the roads of most of those places are too bumpy to drive anyway. That's why I still hike with groups.

Then I looked further, and I saw a small unregular shaped of blue.

However, the path was slippery, and our drivers kept warning everyone to be careful. I guess I was still sleepy, and I didn’t pay enough attention, so I slipped. Luckily, it didn’t do damage to my body, except for my ego.

            Finally, we reached a relatively flat surface, and it turned out one of our hiking mates got stung by bees several times on his head. We were really worried that he might be allergic to bee stings, but it was still a long way to exit the trail. Xiao Tsai used his radio to ask other guides who had reached to the place with phone signals to call for an ambulance. We kept company with our poor hiking mate and checked on him constantly. He said he felt dizzy and weak but was still able to hike on his own, which was a good sign.

          <div class="article__section--content">
            Because our hiking mate was feeling weak, we didn't hike fast, especially on some rough slopes. It took us more than one hour to exit the trail. By the time we reached the trailhead, an ambulance was already there. Later, I know our hiking mate was doing okay. We were very grateful for that.

            Thoughts about This Hike: Definitely Not Again
          </h3>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            There are two kinds NO (please check out the "Never Again Hikes" feature on <a href="../blog.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="post-link-style">Blog</a> page) when I am asked whether I will hike some trails once more. The first one is I-might-change-my-mind-later kind of NO, and the other is DEFINITELY NO. Without a doubt, this is the latter one, because of the sea of bamboo woods, the huge descending, the rough terrains, no views on the peaks, etc., etc.

            Another legit reason is if you want to enhance your hiking experience to take on more challenging hikes in the future, this is the trail for you. Moreover, the views on the sides of the trails are really great. If you embrace the challenges, this hike will be like what Xiao Tsai has said, an easy, happy one.
