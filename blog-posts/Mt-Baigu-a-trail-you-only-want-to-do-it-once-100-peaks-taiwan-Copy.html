            About Mt. Baigu and the Famous (or Notorious) Deadly Accident 
          </h3>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            Mt. Baigu is located between Renai Township in Nantou County 南投縣仁愛鄉 and Heping District in Taichung City 台中市和平區, central Taiwan, and is very close Central Cross-island Highway 中部橫貫公路 or 中橫 in short. The majority of indigenous people live in Renai are <a href="https://www.cip.gov.tw/portal/docList.html?CID=F1AE8ACB51E1D504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="post-link-style">Atayal people</a>.

          <div class="article__section--content">
           One of Atayal’s clans, <a href="https://www.sunriver.com.tw/blog/%E7%99%BD%E5%A7%91%E5%A4%A7%E5%B1%B1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="post-link-style">Xalut 福骨群</a>, has been living around Mt. Baigu for generations. Xalut means people who live in remote mountains. During Japanese Occupation, Xalut turned into Hakku in Japanese, and it was translated into Baigu, which also sounds like white dog in Chinese. That's how the name came from.
          </div>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            100 Peaks or baiyue 百岳 in Chinese is a very famous list (achievement to be exact) among hikers in Taiwan. Mt. Baigu is listed No. 44. Under this list, there are also many sub-lists. Among those 100 peaks, the trailheads of 4 peaks are located on Central Cross-island Highway 中部橫貫公路 or 中橫 in short.

          <div class="article__section--content">      
            Those 4 mountains happen to be difficult to hike. Therefore, those are also nicknamed as <a href="https://hiking.biji.co/index.php?q=news&act=info&id=2772" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="post-link-style">中橫四辣</a>. In Chinese, 辣 means spicy, and it also means it’s difficult to handle. I can’t find the official English name for 中橫四辣, so please bear with me and let’s call it Central Highway 4 Spicy Hikes. The mountains listed on Central Highway 4 Spicy Hikes are <a

Pingfeng 屏風山</a>, ranging from relatively easy to the most challenging one on this list. But some hikers say Mt. Pingfeng is easier than Mt. Baigu after the new trail has been discovered. I can’t comment this because I haven’t been to Mt. Pingfeng. Perhaps someday.

            When you hike 100 Peaks in Taiwan, you have to apply for permit and lodge beds or campsite in advance. However, it’s hassle-free if you want to hike Mt. Baigu. You need to carry your tents and sleeping bags, and definitely a water filter, unless you want to finish it in one day.

            rel="noreferrer noopener" class="post-link-style">Mr. Zhang</a>, went missing when he tried to do a solo hike on Mt. Baigu. It took the rescue team 51 days trying to find him without any results. This is a long story, but this tragedy ignited the debates about mountaineering/hiking safety and education in hiking communities in Taiwan.

            The trailhead is very close to the Last Farmhouse 最後農家 near Hongxiang Hotspring 紅香溫泉. There’s no public transport to get there. You have to drive or hire a car. Please note that it’s better to drive or hire a 4-wheele drive car because of the steepness of the off road to the Last Farmhouse.

The water comes from rain, so those ponds are also called Ponds from Sky 看天池, meaning the water depends on sky. If you want to do your own business, please go to the other side and stay away from the water. Please bring a small cloth and a good filter if you want to draw water from those ponds. You'll know why later. This is also a good place to see the sunset, but I didn't get to see it.

            Meeting before the Hike: Sometimes You Just Want to Challenge Yourself
          </h3>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            When you hike with a hiking association often, you'll get to know their guides, and they will get to know you as well. One of the benefits is the guides will know what your level is and they can help you decide whether you can do this hike or not. As I mentioned, Mt. Baigu isn't an easy hike. I decided I wanted to take this challenge since our guide Hanhan didn't say I couldn't go.  
          </div>             
          <div class="article__section--content">
            In Taiwan, if you do 100 Peaks with hiking associations, they will ask you to join the meeting held at least one month before the departure. The first reason is the guides want to know your hiking experience and decide whether you are fit enough to go. The second one is they will let you know the details about the trails, and things you need to pay extra attention or items you need to bring. You can also ask questions if you have any.

The guides will relentlessly remind us to take the garbage back with us. Our guides also reminded us to bring a water filter and a light day backpack for our second day hike to the peak, especially the latter one. I made a mistake for not using it.

            It took much longer than I thought to draw water from the pond. We had to skim the surface as much as we could and use a cloth to sieve the dirt and debris before using the filter. I kneeled down there for at least 20 minutes to draw around 1 litter. Here was the result after using my filter, which looked much better.

            When the important task of drawing water was done, it was time for dinner. I had already carried extra 1.5 litter of clean water, so I used the ‘favored’ Siyan Ponds water for my ramen. To be honest, the water didn’t taste any different after putting ramen seasoning. As long as you boil the water, it’s quite safe. The problem is it isn’t pleasing to the eyes.

            I woke up several times, and for some unknown reasons I decided to ditch my light backpack, the important thing requested by our guides, and carried my 45L backpack instead to hike to the peak, which proved to be a big mistake later.

            It took us around one hour from our campsite to Mt. Baigu Southeast Peak, and most of this section was doing downhill. Although Mt. Baigu Southeast Peak is over 3,000 meters, it’s not listed as 100 Peaks. It was still dark when we got there, but I could see the sky turning bright and red. It must be great to see the sunrise at Mt. Baigu, but that means you have to get up really early to catch the first beam of sunlight.

            From here, it was mostly downhill again, but I wasn’t particularly excited about it, because I had to hike back here later after I was exhausted. Around 30 minutes, we reached Jita Campsite 吉他營地. It means guitar in Chinese. I have no idea why this is called a campsite, because only one or two tents can be pitched here. A yellow sign saying you could get phone signal here, but I didn’t get many bars.

At that moment, I also realized a stupid mistake I made. I should have carried the light backpack instead of my 45L one. The weight of my empty 45L backpack was 1.8 kg, and I had to carry rain gear, food and water and water filter. I had no idea what I was thinking, and I had to bear (carry to be exact) the consequences.

During the meeting before our hike, Hanhan had shown us what this area looked like, but I didn’t feel anything special till now.

            I didn’t expect to see Falseindianpipe at Mt. Baigu, and I was so excited, almost dancing right there. I could tell it was very humid underneath the rock, which was the best environment for Falseindianpipe to grow. I took as many photos as I could before I had to face the reality, climbing up the steep slope.

            With some struggling, I reached a mild slope with bamboo woods on my both sides and spotted something white again.

I knew Hanhan was waiting for me, but I really wanted to grab this chance to look at those amazing plants.

            To make the hiking back to our campsite, the drizzling turned into big rain. Although hiking back to our campsite was mostly downhill, it was still not easy. I even saw more Falseindianpipe on the trail, but I was too tired to take photos of them. I was content already.

It tasted way much better than the black water, believe me.

            Other than this incident, we met many hikers who decided to finish this hike in one day. Finishing the hike 單攻, especially 100 Peaks, is getting popular in Taiwan, because many hikers don’t want to carry heavy tents and sleeping bags or food. However, it’s not for everyone. One of the female hikers we ran into felt doing it in one day was too much, and she started mumbling something like “I’m so exhausted. I don’t want to do it in one day” whenever she saw us.

            Thoughts about this Hike and Mistakes to Avoid 
          </h3>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            Although most of us said we don’t want to hike to Mt. Baigu anymore, this trail is still wonderful. I still think of those rugged rock slopes, especially those before we reached the summit. In Taiwan, the experience of hiking Mt. Baigu is like a badge of hornor proving you have certain ability to take on difficult hikes in Taiwan. However, there are still things that I could’ve done better to make this hike more enjoyable.

            I brought meals that needed to be cooked for my lunch, but this was a mistake. We only had 40 minutes for our lunch breaks, and cooking the food took too much time. I was a slow hiker and by the time we finished my lunch, other hikers were ready to go. I should have brought meals that were ready to eat.

            Will I recommend this trail? Absolutely. Some people did this hike in 2 days, but I think if you don’t want to be in a rush, planning a 3-day trip will be better. Mt. Baigu is very popular among hikers because you don’t need to apply for permits or lodge beds, which saves a lot of hassles, but the driving to the trailhead can be challenging because of the road condition. It's better to hire a van to take you there.
