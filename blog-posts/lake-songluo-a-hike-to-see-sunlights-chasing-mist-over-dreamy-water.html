             The altitude of Songluo Lake is 1,320 meters (4,330 feet) above the sea level. The wet season of this lake is from October to April, and many hikers prefer to visiti Songluo Lake during this time to see the beautiful lake in the morning sunlight. But I think the lake is still amazing if you go in dry season. Please note that you might not be able to find a camping spot if it rains too much, because it will be difficult to find a dry place to pitch your tent.

            There is no public transport to get close to the trailhead. You have to drive or hire a car. Although Songluo Lake is located in Wulai, New Taipei City, we have to enter the trail from Datong in Yilan. So, I consider this is a hike located in Eastern Taiwan.

            >Hiking Biji</a>, you can take Kingbus 1743, 1744, 1751 and 1798 and get off at Yulan Stop 玉蘭站. It will take about one hour to arrive at the trailhead on foot. But after doing research on Google Map, I still can’t figure out how to get to the trailhead by bus. So, I will still suggest you drive there or hire a car.

            The destination is Songluo Lake, and there is no specific peak to reach on this trail. If you want to explore more, you can hike to Mt. Quantoumu 拳頭母山, 1,551 meters (5,088 feet) at the fork after the sign of 050. The round trip from the fork to Mt. Quantoumu and back to the fork might take around 5 hours, and the trail terrain is very rugged.

            This is my second time to hike Songluo Lake. My first attempt was in 2009, but I didn’t hike often at that time and I wasn’t fit at all. As you can imagine, I didn’t enjoy the whole hike due to my lousy physical condition. After I picked up hiking again, I always wanted to come back here.

I'm glad that we took a long break here because the views at Yulan Tea Farm were so spectacular. You could oversee the mountains and Lanyang Plain 蘭陽平陽 (or Yilan Plain) in the distance.

            After the break, it took us around 10 minutes to get to the parking lot of Songluo Lake. Since this trail is very popular, I wasn’t surprised to see the parking lot was almost packed. From there, it took several minutes (around 250 meters or 0.15 miles in distance) to get to the trailhead.

            There was a big sign with a detailed map at the trailhead telling you things you need to know and what to do if you need to ask for help. The one-way trip to Songluo Lake is only 5.4 km (3.35 miles), and you will see numbered signs (54 ones in total) in yellow every 100 meter and blank yellow ones for you to navigate on the trail. Overall, it is easy to follow the trail.

            Our first stop was the Faucet 水龍頭, which was 2.4 km (1.5 miles) from the trailhead and 190 meter in elevation gain. This elevation part was relatively easy, but it was the humidity you have to deal with in summer. This area is one of the most humid places in Taiwan all year round, so it wasn’t a surprise to see the muddy terrains.

So, hikers shouldn’t turn off the water in winter in case the water gets frozen. We had lunch here. There were so many people at the Faucet that I couldn’t find a shaded area. So, I carried my umbrella hiding underneath it to eat my lunch.

                There are benefits and drawbacks of numbering the distance of the trails. The good thing is you know how much you’ve finished. But the bad thing is this also reminds you that you still have so much to go, especially when the trail is a tough one.

            After the rain died down, we decided to explore around this valley. The lake, to be exact, wasn’t a big lake, and was more like several sporadic ponds. When you walked on the grass/moss, it felt like you were walking on sponges, soft and squishy. However, you might step into water because the moss covered the surface of those ponds and you just couldn’t see the water.

If there weren’t hikers taking photos by the water, I would believe I was in an up-side down world.

While standing in a line, someone flew a drone which caused hikers in front of my overexcitedly jumping up and down, trying to draw attention. I had to turn away to hide my rolling eyes from them and looked at the lake, and I was struck by the view again.

If I missed breakfast now and came back later, I might delay our group’s departure. As a result, I could only watch the marvelous show with those ugly tents in front of me. I could feel my heart was feeling excited but also weeping at the same time.

Usually, most group would head to Nanshi River to fetch fresh water after they arrived at Songluo Lake. I think our porters just took the water from the small ponds near our campsite. There were too many hikers to fetch enough water. I wouldn’t expect them to filter the water, either.

            Songluo Lake has been famous among hikers in Taiwan for years. Therefore, many businesses rely on this trail to earn a living, which means it’s very easy to hire porters to carry tents, sleeping bags and food for hikers. However, during Covid-19, most people including myself don’t feel safe to travel abroad. The domestic travel, especially those destinations in the nature, becomes extremely popular.

            I'm happy to see so many people getting close to the nature, but what they have done isn’t showing any love to the nature at all. Taiwan is a beautiful place, but its beauty is tainted by our lousy behaviors: toilet papers, plastic bottles, booming music, loud chatting and laughers, etc. When it rained in the late evening, I thought I finally could get a quiet night, but I was wrong. The rain didn’t stop hikers’ loud annoying chats.

            Not to mention some hikers used the not so much pond water to wash their utensils. My neighbor told me he saw a film of grease floating on the surface of the pond. I saw at least two hikers brushing their teeth with toothpastes. Did they swallow the toothpaste and water? Of course not.

            I brought a mesh tent with a tarp. I should have set the mesh opening toward the bushes, because too many hikers with excess curiosity just peeked into my tent when they passed by. Some even thought it was totally fine to check on me with their headlamps. Taking a mesh tent doesn’t mean you are welcome to look inside with your headlamp, people.
