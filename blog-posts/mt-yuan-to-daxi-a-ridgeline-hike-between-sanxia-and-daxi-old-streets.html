            Although I took the other trailhead, the views on the side of the road were still stunning with layers mountains from Mt. Xue Range to keep me company. There was a pavilion close to Tzuhui Temple 慈惠堂. It would be so relaxing to have a cup of your favorite drink to enjoy the mountain views there.

            While I was having my breakfast, a short older guy approached me out of nowhere and asked me whether I saw a big group of hikers. I replied no. He then proceeded to explain to me how he was late and missed the group. While I was wondering why he needed to explain his being late to me, he asked me again: where are you going? As seemingly nice as I could be, I replied. Then, he caught me off guard: I’ll go with you.

            Those kinds of hikers are very common in Taiwan. There are so many hiking groups and hikers really don’t have to learn how to read maps, navigate or even bring stoves. Furthermore, many hikers who have finished the 100 peaks still don’t know how to read maps or pitch tents. They go with porters who carry food, tents, sleeping bags and arrive at the campsite or cabins in advance to get things ready for them. Those hikers probably can’t carry much in their backpacks. Most of them are loaded retirees with tons of free time.

            When we reached Mt. Wushifen 五十分山, 296 meters (972 feet), also called Mt. Yuan 鳶山 (two Mt. Yuan???), I told him we took a break here. The view on Mt. Wushifen was great, even though it was crowded there. But I was happy to see the crowd because I told Uncle Slow that the following trail was long, and it would take him much longer to finish. So, I asked him to go with those hikers.

            I could tell Uncle Slow wasn’t very pleased about that, but that wasn’t my concern. He had ruined my hike and I decided enough was enough. After taking photos, I said goodbye to him, hoping never seeing him again. Finally, my solo hike had begun.

            The following trail was steeper than the previous section, but still easy to hike. And most importantly, I felt much better without Uncle Slow. I could make my own pace and really enjoyed being alone. I started paying attention to my surroundings and mountains in the distance.

            Therefore, if I do this trail again, I will start the hike from Miaofa Temple in Daxi instead. After you finish the hike, you can get to Sanxia Old Street right away and there are many buses going to Banqiao and MRT stations.
