Otherwise, they have to carry those things on foot. Life isn’t easy for them, but this simple lifestyle gives them the most stunning nature in return.

            Before you go, you need to check whether the trails are <a href="https://npm.cpami.gov.tw/en/open.aspx" class="post-link-style" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open</a> for the public to hike. Sometimes, the trails are closed due to the landslide or other reasons.

This is a B&B located on a tableland overlooking the most epic valleys and mountains in eastern Taiwan. There's hot water for you to take a hot shower, but no hair dryer, because they need the solar power for the essential appliances.<br />
            You can choose to share the big bed with other hikers indoors or stay inside a tent provided by them. The cost includes two meals (breakfast and dinner). There's some internet access. It’s better to make a phone call to book your stay at least 2 weeks in advance.

            Dekalun Trail wasn’t long, around 1.3 km, and then we reached a very steep slope. My cramped legs still gave me a hard time, and I had to stop several times to massage them, which made my hike much slower. Our guide told me to take salt to relieve the condition, and it helped a little bit. Luckily, my cramp wasn’t too serious. I've seen a female hiker who suffered a very bad cramp, and she sat on the trail screaming because of the pain.

            I turned to the mountains to see where the pulley went. It went all the way up to the somewhere on the hilltop. The pulley or cableway used to transport logs. The logging industry had been active for more than 100 years in Taiwan before it came to a halt when government issued the ban of virgin forest logging in 1980s. However, illegal loggings still happen from time to time, and this is another story to tell.

            There were signs warning about the risks of wasps and snakes. We didn’t have many typhoons coming to Taiwan in 2020, and many wasp nests remained intact, which led to many hikers being stung on the trails in different parts of Taiwan. It’s definitely not fun to have a close encounter with those tiny worriers.

            There was a sign saying that hikers could camp here for NT$150 per person. I couldn't help but imagine the starry sky I could see at night here. After I was satisfied, I got back to the tree and had my lunch while enjoying the valley and mountains with the fluffy clouds floating in the bright blue sky.

            Then, we reached Sanjianwu 三間屋, which was the end of the steep hike and we had our lunch break. While having my food, I saw the first arrival of two rescue team members riding their scooters. Although the trail was flat after Sanjianwu, the uneven trail terrain still made their scooter riding difficult, which means the rest of the team had to get to there on foot.

            There are many options to enjoy your stay in this place. 1. Stay in Hualien for one night and get to Taroko Visitor Center to start your hike and stay at Sapah Tadaw Mawna for another night. If I have enough time, I’d love to stay there at least for 2 nights.
