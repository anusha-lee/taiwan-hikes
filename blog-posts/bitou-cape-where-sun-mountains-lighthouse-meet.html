            to get a seat number at the ticket booth first to ensure you’ll have
            a seat during summer. The bus driver told us that they will let

            Even so, the views on the Valley Trail are already stunning enough.
            You get to see the ridgeline winding on several hills from both
            sides. When you stop at the pavilion and look on your left, you will
            be amazed by the fjord like mountains.

            You can also start your hike from this side. There’s a temple,
            Xinxing Temple 新興宮, and signs for you to follow the trail. I will
            suggest you start your hike from Bitou Elementary School, because
            you can have some local food after your hike. Nothing much to eat

            As I said earlier, the first section of the trail was easy, just
            strolling on the trail to enjoy the view. When we reached the
            lighthouse, we climbed up the hill behind the lighthouse. This hill
            was very steep and there wasn’t much for you to grab. I decided not
            to reach the top and stayed in the middle to take photos.

            The white Bitou Cape Lighthouse with the deep blue sea in the
            background was astonishing, and it looked like a pearl being wrapped
            by a blue velvet. You can also get a bird’s eye view of the rock
            formation on the seashore. Unfortunately, I forgot to take photos. I
            only shot one shaky video. But if you think the view from the video
            is amazing, it will be at least 100 times better if you get a chance

            I also saw the trail we were going to take next. The deep blue sea
            and vivid green layers of hills made me excited and wonder what we
            would see next. Please remember that the trail was very
            narrow. It would be very dangerous if two hikers try to pass with
            each other at the same time. I can understand why the local
            government wants to close this trail.

            It was a gorgeous sunny day in autumn when we were there, and no
            wonder so many people wanted to hike on the trail. The steep slope
            also made the ascending/descending much slower. At some points, we
            had to stop and waited. Thus, we got a traffic jam. This is one of

            When I thought I finally passed the most difficult part, another
            trial was awaiting me. I saw the those rocks I had to pass. The
            guides told us the technique to descend was to extend your arms and
            legs among those rocks like the Spiderman. If you are not used to rock climbing, this one will be difficult, at least for me.

            As you can imagine, this was not a proud moment for me, and I could
            sense the two guides who were trying to help me were losing
            patience. I don’t blame them at all. They had given a warning before
            the trip, and I didn’t know it was that terrifying.

            Although the shore is dirty, the magnificent sea cliff caves still
            stand out. The cliffs have been eroded by the sea for millions of
            years and those are like a masterpiece. When I visited here again in
            April 2020, I wanted to get a closer look at those caves. So, I
            stayed at the caves a little longer to admire them before moving on.

            The northeast part of Taiwan is my favorite place to visit, because
            the coastline is so spectacular. Before I started hiking seriously,
            I took the bus here just to see the amazing coastlines. If you can
            stay in Taiwan for a longer period of time, you definitely have put
            this part in your itinerary. If you hike here in summer, please
            remember to protect yourself from the sun, because there's not much
            shade on the trails.

            closed. As to the valley trail, it's very easy to get around by
            following the stairs.
