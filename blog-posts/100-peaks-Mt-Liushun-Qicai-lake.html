            Once upon a time, hikers or tourists could just drive or take a bus to Qicai Lake and hiked Qicai and Mt. Liushun within one day or two, but not anymore. It will never be in the future. Now it has become a 100+ km journey. Let’s begin.

            The total length of Danda Forest Road is 62 km (38.5 miles). The old name of Danda Forest Road was Sunhai Forest Road 孫海林道, and it was built by a lumber businessman Sun Hai in 1957 to transport lumber. Mt. Sun acquired the timber right of 5,000 hectares (12,355 acres) of Danda forest in 1958, about the size of 9,300 football fields. In his heyday, his company Zenchang 振昌興業 hired more than 2,000 people, 60% of the population in a logging town, <a href="https://www.sunmoonlake.gov.tw/en/attractions/detail/162" class="post-link-style" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Checheng 車埕</a>, working for him. His company was also <a href="https://www.cw.com.tw/article/5019357?template=fashion" class="post-link-style" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the first one</a> that exported Taiwan Cypress to Japan.

            In 1990, Taiwan government changed its policies, banned logging and focused more on preserving the environment. So how much of Danda forest had been logged? According to the program, <a href="https://ourisland.pts.org.tw/content/4005" class="post-link-style" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our Island of Taiwan Public Television Service</a>, around 14,350 hectares (35,460 acres) of total 42,282.77 hectares (104,483 acres) Danda forest have been lost due to logging industry and agriculture activities. 1/3 of Danda forest is gone, equal to 26,691 football fields. However, illegal logging is still a serious issue in this area and other forests in Taiwan.

            Mt. Sun Hai built a bridge above Zhuosui River to transport timbers, and as you can guess the bridge is called Sunhai Bridge 孫海橋. This bridge was a wooden structure when it was first built in 1957, and it was the only passage for Danda area to connect to the outside world. Nantou County government rebuilt this bridge and changed it into a concrete one in 1969, and it was also the end of Provincial Highway 16 台6線.

            However, Typhoon Mindulle 敏督利 destroyed Danda Forest Road and Sunhai Bridge in 2004. After evaluation, Executive Yuan decided not to rebuild Sunhai Bridge, but Bunun people still needed to visit their ancestors’ sacred place and Taipower staff needed to maintain the transmission towers through Danda Forest Road. So, the government built Danda Suspension Bridge 丹大吊橋 that could only allow motorbikes to pass.

          <div class="article__section--content">            
            Nevertheless, Typhoon Sinlaku 辛樂克 destroyed Danda Suspension Bridge again in 2008. Since then, Bunun people, Foresty Bureau and Taipower staff relied on pulley to cross the river. Later, Taipower Company built temporary steel bridge to maintain the transmission towers.

            Forest Bureau decided to close this trail for the safety reasons after 2004 and also hoped to prevent illgal logging from happening. Therefore, there was a period of time that hikers had to play cat and mouse game by hiking the sidehills and bypass to avoid being caught. Finally, Forest Bureau opened up Dadan Forest Road again in 2018, and only vehicles, hikers and cyclists with permits can visit this beautiful place.

            After Japanese Occupation and some policies from ruling parties, many younger Bunun are losing touch with their cultures and customs. Therefore, Bunun people start the journey to seek their roots and visit their old homes where their ancestors had been buried in remote Danda area. This ritual is similar to Han people’s tomb sweeping to remember and honor the deceased.

            In 1989, Taipower Company expanded this forest road to Qicai Lake for the power transmission.

Since Sunhai Bridge collapsed in 2004 and the government has no intention to rebuild it, hiking to Qicai Lake and Mt. Liushun has become an extraordinary feat testing hikers’ ability and willpower.

            I didn’t know how long we had hiked on this shortcut, and the treacherous terrains made me out of breath. I felt the 15-kg weight dragging me down on my shoulders. Something wrong with my backpack, and it was a stupid mistake that I didn’t fix it soon enough.

            Then, here came Tian Stairs 天梯. In Chinese, it means Sky Stairs. It is said that there were 4,000+ steps and the elevation loss was 750 meters. If you start this hike from the east, the elevation gain would be 750 meters.

            After the bridge, we reached Jiuzu Cabin 九族山莊. We were the last small group in our big group, and our guide, Mingshu, who kept us company received a radio call from guides before us saying a hiker wasn’t feeling okay and Mingshu had the satellite light phone and need to call for help.

            As a result, we stay at Jiuzu Cabin for a long time trying to make a call. However, it didn’t work. Later, Mingshu got another radio call that the hiker seemed to be better.

            Then, Mingshu got a radio call from Xiaotsai and Xiaotsai would turn back to look for us. I was so grateful that Xiaotsai came back to help us, because there was a big slope, and it was difficult to pass. Perhaps it was good that we hiked in the dark without seeing much. When I got to see what the slope looked like later, I was surprised.

            As usual, we left Adao Cabin in the dark. Before we set off, I finally did something I should have done on my first day. I took my Mystery Ranch backpack to Damei and asked her for help. She took some time to readjust the torso length of my backpack and told me to try it again. My Mystery Ranch backpack felt totally different. Most of the weight distributed on my waist and my shoulders felt so much lighter. I cursed my stupidity for not doing this sooner.

            Although I fixed the backpack problem, the burning sensation on my feet was getting worse. I was sure it wasn’t the blisters. I guess most people would feel more of less of this after hiking 20+ km three days in a row. The only thing I could do was to suck it up and keep going.

            When we were on the trail, our guide Mingshu said he was worried that it might rain on our last day. We had been seeing sea of clouds for days, but why we were still able to see the sunny weather was because we were above the clouds. Now we were descending, and it might rain. Lucky for us, when we made a turn here, we saw the bright morning sunshine with the blue sky.

            A temple showed up in front of me. I didn’t remember the name of the temple at that time, but I didn’t stop to check the name or the millage. All I knew at that moment was I wanted to end this so bad.

            First, I carried too much. I later found out I brought some items that I never used during this hike, like a small foldable chair. On the contrary, I didn’t bring enough trail snacks and my kind hiking mates shared theirs with me (they brought too much). I totally forgot it was winter and I might eat more to beat the cold.

            As to the meals for breakfasts and dinners, LOHAS had an option of shared meals 公糧, meaning guides would help us prepare breakfasts and dinners and we carried those food ingredients together, which has already reduced some weight for me. I’ve been thinking about bringing my own meals and trail snacks based on the approximate calories I’ll need for my next long-distance hike to see how it goes.

            Other than brining too many unnecessary items, the second mistake I made is I didn’t adjust the torso length of my backpack properly. When I bought this one at the gear shop, the shop staff put a 10-kg weight in my backpack and help me adjust the torso length to test before I decided to buy it. Obviously, I should have asked for help on my first day. Lesson learned.

            We did this high-altitude hike in winter, and it was very cold not just in the early morning and late evening. When we were on the sections with the shade, it was also very cold. However, it felt like summer on those exposed areas because of the high altitude.

            I wore my heavy wool base layer and leggings underneath my light-weight wool shirt to beat the cold, but it was so hot when I was under the sun. It was so hot that I took off my base layer twice during this hike. Damei later told me that they never wear base layer even though it was snowing. She and other guides have been to so many 100 Peaks and they might have used to the cold weather. I’ll need to find a solution to solve this problem.

            On Day 3, the underside of my feet started to hurt, and my toes felt like they were squeezed together, even though I’d wore thick wool socks. I asked my fellow hiking mates and guides, and most of them experienced the same thing, except those who wore five finger socks. But I don’t like wearing five finger socks.

            My friend joked that everything would hurt eventually when you do a 100-km hike. He got a point, but I think there should be some solutions to solve this issue, like getting a better pair of hiking boots and insoles. Some of our guides wore raining boots, and I did the same thing for my other 100 Peaks hike. This will be an expensive experiment for my next long-distance hike.
