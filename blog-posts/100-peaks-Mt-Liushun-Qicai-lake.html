            The total length of Danda Forest Road is 62 km (38.5 miles). The old name of Danda Forest Road was Sunhai Forest Road 孫海林道, and it was built by a lumber businessman Sun Hai in 1957 to transport lumber. Mt. Sun acquired the timber right of 5,000 hectares (12,355 acres) of Danda forest in 1958, and the area was about the size of 9,300 football fields. In his heyday, his company Zenchang 振昌興業 hired more than 2,000 people, 60% of the population in a logging town, <a href="https://www.sunmoonlake.gov.tw/en/attractions/detail/162" class="post-link-style" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Checheng 車埕</a>, working for him.

            The biggest Torii Gate located at Meiji Jingu Shrine in Toykeo was exported from Taiwan by Mt. Sun.

            In 1990, Taiwan government changed its policies, banned logging and focused more on preserving the environment. According to the program, <a href="https://ourisland.pts.org.tw/content/4005" class="post-link-style" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Our Island On Taiwan Public Television Service</a>, around 14,350 hectares (35,460 acres) of total 42,282.77 hectares (104,483 acres) Danda forest had been lost due to logging industry and agriculture activities. 1/3 of Danda forest is gone, equal to 26,691 football fields. However, illegal logging is still a serious issue in this area and other forests in Taiwan.

            Mr. Sun Hai built a bridge above Zhuosui River to transport timbers, and as you can guess the bridge is called Sunhai Bridge 孫海橋. This bridge was a wooden structure when it was first built in 1957, and it was the only passage for Danda area to connect to the outside world. Nantou County government rebuilt this bridge into a concrete one in 1969, and it was also the end of Provincial Highway 16 台16線.

Long story short, the topographic map first used by the first group of hikers to Mt. Liushun was made in 1957. The techniques have been improved a lot over the past few decades, and the height of Mt. Liushun was revised to 2,999 meters (9,839 feet) in 1987.

            By the time we reached Sunhai Bridge, it was around 6:30 am. Our drivers asked us to get off our vans to walk across the temporary steel bridge for safety reasons. Usually, hikers started their hike from the bridge. But lucky for us, our hired vans were 4-wheel-drive, and our drivers were very nice to take us 4.5 km further to the Second Office, which saved us 4.5 km hike.

            I saw a female cyclist took a break with her dog. The dog carried a small backpack on its shoulder, and it stopped and ran back to its owner when it realized she stopped. I could tell she was already exhausted, and the poor dog even made more trips running back and forth. You’ll need to apply for permit to ride your bike on this trail.

In the middle of the night, I had to do my business. I put on my headlamp, took my things and found a place. When I turned off my headlamp, the moonlight was so bright that I didn’t really need any light. Doing business under the beautiful moonlight is such a unique experience.

           Many years ago, hikers took this railway track to Mt. Liushun. However, those railway ties were decayed. It was dangerous to walk on them. Now, hikers don’t take this railway anymore. Some hikers would stay at Gaodeng for one night if they started this hike from the east.

We were the last small group in our big group, and our guide, Mingshu, who kept us company, received a radio call from guides before us saying a hiker wasn’t feeling okay and Mingshu had the satellite light phone and needed to call for help.

            As a result, we stay at Jiuzu Cabin for a long time trying to contact the civilized world. However, it didn’t work.

            Then, Mingshu got a radio call from Xiaotsai saying he would turn back to look for us. I was so grateful that Xiaotsai came back to help us, because there was a big slope, and it was difficult to pass. Perhaps it was good that we hiked in the dark without seeing much. When I got to see what the slope looked like later, I was surprised.

            We left Adao Cabin in the dark. Before we set off, I finally did something I should have done on my first day. I took my Mystery Ranch backpack to Damei and asked her for help. She took some time to readjust the torso length of my backpack and told me to try it again. My Mystery Ranch backpack felt totally different. Most of the weight distributed on my waist and my shoulders felt so much lighter. I cursed my stupidity for not doing this sooner.

          <div class="article__section--content">
            Although I fixed the backpack problem, the burning sensation on my feet was getting worse. I was sure it wasn’t the blisters. I guess most people would feel more of less of this after hiking 20+ km three days in a row. The only thing I could do was to suck it up and keep going.

            When we were on the trail, our guide Mingshu was worried that it might rain on our last day of hike. We had been seeing sea of clouds for days, but why we still could enjoy the sunny weather was because we were above the clouds. Now we were descending into the clouds. Lucky for us, the weather cleared up with the sunshine and blue sky.

            First, I carried too much. I later found out I brought some items that I never used during this hike, like a small foldable chair. On the contrary, I didn’t bring enough trail snacks and my kind hiking mates kindly shared theirs with me (they brought too much). I totally forgot it was winter and I might eat more to beat the cold.

            As to the meals for breakfasts and dinners, LOHAS has an option of shared meals 公糧, meaning guides will help us prepare breakfasts and dinners and we carry those ingredients, which has already reduced some weight for me. I’m planning to bring my own meals and trail snacks based on the approximate calories I’ll need for my next long-distance hike to see how it goes.

            Other than brining too many unnecessary items, the second mistake I made is I didn’t adjust the torso length of my backpack properly. When I bought this one at the gear shop, the shop staff put a 10 kg weight in those backpacks for me to try, and helped me adjust the torso length before I decided to buy one. Obviously, there was something wrong with the adjusting and I should have asked for help on my first day. Lesson learned.

            We did this high-altitude hike in winter, and it was very cold not just in the early morning and late evening. When we were on the sections with the shade, it was also very cold. However, it felt like summer on those exposed areas.

            I wore my heavy wool base layer and leggings underneath my light-weight wool shirt to beat the cold, but it became too hot when I was under the sun. It was so hot that I had to take off my base layer twice on the trail. Damei later told me that they never wear base layer even though it was snowing. She and other guides have been to so many 100 Peaks and they might have used to the cold weather. I’ll need to find a solution to solve this problem.

            On Day 3, the underside of my feet started to hurt, and my toes felt like they were squeezed together, even though I’d wore thick wool socks. I got a blister near the nail of my right little toe, too.  I asked my fellow hiking mates and guides, and most of them experienced the same thing, except those who wore five finger socks. But I don’t like wearing five finger socks.

            My friend joked that everything would hurt eventually when you did a 100-km hike. He has a point, but I think there should be some solutions to solve this issue, like getting a better pair of hiking boots and insoles. Some of our guides wore raining boots, and I did the same thing for my other 100 Peaks hikes. This might be an expensive experiment for my next long-distance hike.

            Some hikers got up early to Mt. Liushun from Qicai Lake campsite to see the sunrise, but I personally think seeing the sunrise in Qicai Lake is the best. No matter which route you take, please arrange one stay at the campsite above Qicai Lake, so you can see the stunning sunrise the next morning.
