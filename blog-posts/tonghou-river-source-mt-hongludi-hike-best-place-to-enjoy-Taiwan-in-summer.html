            Year 2020 was truly a difficult year. On January 2nd, one Black Hawk helicopter carrying several high-ranking military officers suddenly crashed in the mountainous district of Wulai in New Taipei City. Of the 13 passengers and crew on board, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2020/01/02/asia/taiwan-helicopter-crash-intl-hnk/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="post-link-style">8 lost their lives, sadly including the Chief of the General Staff Shen Yi-ming 沈一鳴</a>.

            I hiked this trail on July 21st, 2018 and I had a very scary accident which could end up ugly. Lucky for me, I’m still here. After that, I have a new fear towards certain kind of trail terrains like sidehills and heights. I'm glad that it didn't stop me from hiking and I always wanted to get back to Tonghou River to do it properly. This post mainly focuses on my second hike, but I will put some photos from my first one.

            I joined Dudu for this hike. As usual, we left Banqiao at 7:00 am and arrived at the parking lot near Wei-Shui Chiang Memorial Cemetery around 9 am. We went to Wei-Shui Chiang Memorial Cemetery to take some photos and returned to the dirt road.

Sanjiaolun was also overlapped with the loop trail we were going to take later. Mt.

            How Did My Accident Happen

            On July 21, 2018, I joined 
            <a href="https://densanler.pixnet.net/blog" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener" class="post-link-style">Densanler 登山樂</a> to hike this trail. When we arrived at this slope, I was busy with taking photos of the river. I remember I didn’t stop to put my phone in my fanny bag, which was a mistake. Then, when I was on the slope, I was too confident to make sure I had grabbed the rope on the slope properly before moving my feet forward. Before I knew it, I found myself losing my footing. When I slipped, the only thing I could do was trying to grab anything frantically, but I got nothing. At that moment, I said to myself: ok, that’s it. I stopped struggling and waiting for the end to come.

After making sure I was okay, he asked a male hiker to keep me company, and I finished the rest of the hike.

            When I reflected what happened later, I think I made several mistakes. The biggest one is I was too confident. I didn’t make sure I was secured before I made the next move and I wanted to pass the slope as soon as I could. After this accident, I have a fear when passing the sidehill, but I learn to go with the fear as much as I can. My back still feels weird sometimes. So, stay humble, be cautious, and there's no need to be in a rush on the trails. Those are the lessons I learn from this accident.

            Back to my second hike, when it was my turn to pass the slope, the memory came back, which wasn’t a surprise. But this time I made sure I had grabbed the rope tightly and put my feet steadily before I moved. Within a few minutes, I crossed the slope and reached to a wider trail section. It was not too bad. How come I didn’t do it properly two years ago?

It's definitely a great getaway to refresh yourself.
