            A Steep Beginning to Wake You Up
          </h4>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            The trail terrains were typical in Taiwan: soil intertwined with tree roots and rocks, but it wasn’t difficult to navigate. There were also many plastic ribbons tied on the trees to help me follow the trail, and I saw a stair leading up to a huge water tank on my right. Quickly it went uphill. While I was working hard to climb up, I saw Wulai and River Nanshi through the tree branches.

            To my delight, there weren’t many hikers on the trail. The first people I met were the residents living in Wulai, a guy and two teenage boys doing a short hike. When the guy learned that I went solo, he told the boys that Auntie (which is me) was really good 阿姨好厲害.

            When I do solo hikes and meet other hikers on the trails, I usually got either of the following two reactions. The first one is ‘You are good’, and the other is ‘you shouldn’t hike by yourself’. Lucky me because I encountered both comments on that day. In Taiwan, it’s not popular or even encouraged to do solo hikes, because people think you can’t get help if accidents happen, not to mention females doing solo hikes. To be honest, I’m not special at all. I just want to enjoy the trail by myself.

            After saying goodbye to them, I continued my hike. it was quiet on the trail and I had to stop several times to catch my breath. There weren’t many forks on this trail, so I didn’t have to spend much time to navigate. Then, I reached my first peak on the trail, Mt. Wulai Front Peak 烏來山前峰, 789 meters (2,588 feet).

            Kueishan isn’t the only power plant that sells popsicles in Taiwan, and you must be wondering why power plants sell popsicles. When Kueishan Power Plant was under construction in 1940s, Taipower Company needed tons of ice to cool down the concrete to build the dam. So, they bought many ice making machines to produce the ice.
