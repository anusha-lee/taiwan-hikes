            70% of Taiwan is covered by mountains and complex terrains, which
            shapes special hiking culture. I like doing solo hikes, but I still
            join hiking associations for group hikes. The main reason is the
            safety, and the second one is I get to see the most beautiful views
            in Taiwan when hiking with groups. Without those associations, I
            don’t think I could get to those remote places. Therefore, I highly
            recommend visitors from other countries to hike with local hiking
            associations, because this will save you time to do research about
            the trails and, most importantly, you feel safe when hiking with the
            experienced locals.

            2. Difficulty Levels Might Be Different from Your Home Countries
          </h3>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            At first glance, you might think the hiking distance in Taiwan is
            very short. You even will find trips less than 10 km (6.2 miles).
            However, the jungle terrains make the short hikes more time
            consuming, and you may need to take extra efforts to traverse in the
            woods. Having a short distance doesn’t mean those hikes will be
            easier.
          </div>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            Before we discuss the difficulty levels, there are several criteria
            about difficulty rating of trails in Taiwan. There are at least 3
            kinds of trails defined by the altitudes and accessibility:
          </div>
          <h4 class="article__section--reasonTitle">
            The 100 Peaks in Taiwan
          </h4>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            The 100 Peaks in Taiwan, Three-thousander trails, or Top 100, or
            Baiyue 百岳 in Chinese, refer to the peak elevations greater 3,000
            meters (9,842 feet) above sea level. Most of those locate within the
            National Parks in Taiwan and hikers need to apply for permits for
            hiking and camping.

          <h4 class="article__section--reasonTitle">
            Mid-range Mountain Trails, or 中級山
          </h4>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            Mid-range Mountain Trails, or 中級山, refer to those elevations
            between 1,000 meter and 3,000 meters (between 3,281 and 9,842 feet).
            Some define them between 1,500 meters and 3,000 meters (between
            4,921 and 9,842 feet). Some of those are very remote, and hikers
            need to drive or arrange private transportation to get to the
            trails. Sometimes hikers have to stay the closest hotel, B&B, or
            camp near those trails to save time.
          </div>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            Mid-range Mountain Trails can be very challenging. I personally
            think Mid-range Mountain Trails in Taiwan are underrated. Some
            trails locate in national nature preserved areas, so you need to
            apply for permit in advance, but it’s way much easier compared to
            the process of the 100 peaks. However, the views you can see on
            those trails aren’t any less amazing than those on the 100 peaks.

            One thing to bear in mind is those trails aren’t for everyone.
            Hiking on those trails requires a better physical condition, and
            most of the hiking guides will ask hikers to provide their hiking
            experience before joining the group hikes. The guides also have the
            right to turn you down if they don’t think this trail is for you.

            This name is translated literally from Chinese. Those trails do not
            necessary locate in the suburban or near the cities, but usually
            they are below 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) above sea level. Some of
            those trails can be very challenging. For example, you might need to
            hike through creeks, climb up and down steep slopes or narrow
            ridges. Usually, the difficulty levels of those trails are also
            categorized in 3 levels: easy, moderate, challenging. Those trails
            can be finished within one day and most of them can be access by
            public transportations.
          </div>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            In Taiwan, hiking over 12 km (7.5 miles) can be deemed as a
            long-distance hike because of the complex terrains like mud. In
            Europe or in the U.S. or other countries, hiking 20+ km or even 20+
            miles in one day seems to be normal, but the jungles in Taiwan
            increase the hiking difficulty, and can make the hike much more
            difficult.
          </div>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            Local government and some hiking organizations will establish new
            trail categories to encourage the public to go hiking. Some of those
            trails can be connected into a long-distance hike. If you take a
            wrong turn, you might end up in a different trail and exit in a
            totally different place. Therefore, please prepare a map or GPX on
            your navigation device when you go hiking in Taiwan. The jungle-like
            terrains usually make things more complicated.

            High Altitudes ≠ Difficulty
          </h4>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            One thing that please bears in mind is the difficulty level is not
            necessarily associated with the elevations. Many Mid-range Mountain
            Trails are more difficult than the 100 Peaks because of the total
            descending and ascending and the terrains. Many trails on the 100
            Peaks are easier to detect than those on the Mid-range ones. Some
            Suburb Mountain Trails can also make you curse yourself for hiking
            there, too. I once hiked a Mid-range Mountain Trail, Mt. Baxian Main
            Peak Trail 八仙山主峰,
            (https://l2112021.pixnet.net/blog/post/221199755) with more than
            1,300 meters (4,265 feet) in total descending and ascending. I still
            don’t know how I made it.
          </div>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            The best example might be Mt. Yu, 3,952 m (12,966 ft), the highest
            mountain in Taiwan. There are still some dangerous sections on the
            trail, but overall, it’s not as difficult as you thought. However,
            the most difficult part about hiking in Mt. Yu is to win the lottery
            draw to get a sleeping space at Baiyun Lodge. There are even at
            least 3 levels of difficulty for the 100 Peaks labeled by the
            National Parks, starting from A, which is the easiest one.

            You can go with the hiking associations or organize your own trips
            for the 100 Peaks. Most hiking associations hold the 100 Peak trips
            on the weekends, which means other hikers also want to hike there on
            the same dates and makes it even more difficult to get a permit,
            especially the long weekends. Due to the limited cabin and campsite
            capacity, the National Parks will draw lots to decide who can get
            the cabins or campsites. Failing to get a bed or campsite for
            several times isn’t something new. Almost every hiker here will
            experience that occasionally.

            If you are lucky enough to get a bed, now you will have to wait to
            see if the weather will be in your favor. Because hikers have to
            send their applications one or two months in advance, it’s really
            difficult to predict how the weather will be before you can finally
            departure.
          </div>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            Another thing to worry is the altitude sickness or mountain sickness
            (https://www.webmd.com/a-to-z-guides/altitude-sickness#1). The
            altitude sickness can happen when hikers climb to elevation over
            2,500 meters (8,202 feet) too fast, and it can cause deaths. The
            only way to relieve the sickness is to move to lower elevation as
            soon as possible. That's why every guide in the group will ask
            hikers to report any illness to them, no matter how minor you think
            it is, because those symptoms can get worse that things might be out
            of control. Hikers in Taiwan usually will visit the doctors a few
            days before the hike to get some medicine for precaution.

            Xue, 雪山. I've seen both Mt. Xue and Syue Mountain on the trail,
            not to mention Mt. Snow, which is literally translated from Chinese.

            others share the cost. However, when the car breaks down or gets
            into accident or a traffic ticket, what to do with the rest trip or
            the extra cost? For trips held by hiking associations, the lead
            guides have the authority to make the decisions agreed upon
            beforehand, and they’ve been trained to deal with emergencies. If

            dates for us to enjoy the most beautiful views. He also shared many

            learn new things from the locals. That's why I highly recommend
            visitors to hike with the local hiking associations, because you get

          <h3 class="article__section--title">Hiking Is Not A Sightseeing</h3>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            Last but not least, one thing should be born in mind is hiking
            should be labeled as an outdoor sport, not sightseeing, from my
            humble opinion. Hiking and sightseeing require different levels of
            physical strength, clothing, gear, and knowledge toward the
            activities, the nature and risk managements. Besides, hiking
            involves greater dangers which might cause injuries or even death.

            New Regulations about Hiking on the Way
          </h3>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            In 2019, Taiwan government has announced it’s going to change the
            laws and regulations toward hiking activities and remove the
            restrictions of mountain trekking after the death of

            , we are not certain how the new regulations will be at this moment,
            because it’s still in progress. I’ll update the new ones when the
            government issues them.
