            70% of Taiwan is covered by mountains and complex terrains, which
            shapes special hiking culture. I like doing solo hikes, but I still
            join hiking associations for group hikes. The main reason is the
            safety, and the second one is I get to see the most beautiful views
            in Taiwan when hiking with groups. Without those associations, I
            don’t think I could get to those remote places. Therefore, I highly
            recommend visitors from other countries to hike with local hiking
            associations, because this will save you time to do research about
            the trails and, most importantly, you feel safe when hiking with the
            experienced locals.

          </h3>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            At first glance, you might think the hiking distance in Taiwan is
            very short. You even will find trips less than 10 km (6.2 miles).
            However, the jungle terrains make the short hikes more time
            consuming, and you may need to take extra efforts to traverse in the
            woods. Having a short distance doesn’t mean those hikes will be
            easier.

            Before we discuss the difficulty levels, there are several criteria

            kinds of trails defined by the altitudes and accessibility:

            The 100 Peaks in Taiwan, Three-thousander trails, or Top 100, or

            meters (9,842 feet) above sea level. Most of those locate within the

          </h4>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            Mid-range Mountain Trails, or 中級山, refer to those elevations
            between 1,000 meter and 3,000 meters (between 3,281 and 9,842 feet).
            Some define them between 1,500 meters and 3,000 meters (between
            4,921 and 9,842 feet). Some of those are very remote, and hikers
            need to drive or arrange private transportation to get to the
            trails. Sometimes hikers have to stay the closest hotel, B&B, or
            camp near those trails to save time.

            Mid-range Mountain Trails can be very challenging. For those who
            want to avoid altitude sickness but still want to experience the
            unique beauty in the wilderness in Taiwan, I highly recommend
            Mid-range Mountain Trails. Some trails locate in national nature
            preserved areas, so you need to apply for permits in advance, but
            it’s easier than applying to the 100 peaks. The views you can see on
            those trails aren’t any less amazing than those on the 100 peaks.

            One thing to bear in mind is those trails aren’t for everyone.
            Hiking on those trails requires a better physical condition, and
            most of the hiking guides will ask hikers to provide their hiking
            experience before joining the group hikes. The guides also have the
            right to turn you down if they don’t think this trail is for you.

            This name is translated literally from Chinese. Those trails do not
            necessary locate in the suburban or near the cities, but usually
            they are below 1,000 meters (3,280 feet) above sea level. Some of
            those trails can be very challenging. For example, you might need to
            hike through creeks, climb up and down steep slopes or narrow
            ridges. Usually, the difficulty levels of those trails are also
            categorized in 3 levels: easy, moderate, challenging. Those trails
            can be finished within one day and most of them can be access by
            public transportations.
          </div>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            In Taiwan, hiking over 12 km (7.5 miles) can be deemed as a
            long-distance hike because of the complex terrains like mud. In
            Europe or in the U.S. or other countries, hiking 20+ km or even 20+
            miles in one day seems to be normal, but the jungles in Taiwan
            increase the hiking difficulty, and can make the hike much more
            difficult.
          </div>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            Local government and some hiking organizations will establish new
            trail categories to encourage the public to go hiking. Some of those
            trails can be connected into a long-distance hike. If you take a
            wrong turn, you might end up in a different trail and exit in a
            totally different place. Therefore, please prepare a map or GPX on
            your navigation device when you go hiking in Taiwan. The jungle-like
            terrains usually make things more complicated.

            High Altitudes ≠ Difficulty
          </h4>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            One thing that please bears in mind is the difficulty level is not
            necessarily associated with the elevations. Many Mid-range Mountain
            Trails are more difficult than the 100 Peaks because of the total
            descending and ascending and the terrains. Many trails on the 100
            Peaks are easier to detect than those on the Mid-range ones. Some
            Suburb Mountain Trails can also make you curse yourself for hiking
            there, too. I once hiked a Mid-range Mountain Trail, Mt. Baxian Main
            Peak Trail 八仙山主峰,
            (https://l2112021.pixnet.net/blog/post/221199755) with more than
            1,300 meters (4,265 feet) in total descending and ascending. I still
            don’t know how I made it.
          </div>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            The best example might be Mt. Yu, 3,952 m (12,966 ft), the highest
            mountain in Taiwan. There are still some dangerous sections on the
            trail, but overall, it’s not as difficult as you thought. However,
            the most difficult part about hiking in Mt. Yu is to win the lottery
            draw to get a sleeping space at Baiyun Lodge. There are even at
            least 3 levels of difficulty for the 100 Peaks labeled by the
            National Parks, starting from A, which is the easiest one.

            you type one Chinese phrase. For example, the translations on Mt.
            Xue, 雪山. I've seen both Mt. Xue and Syue Mountain on the trail,
            not to mention Mt. Snow, which is literally translated from Chinese.
            When you hike the highest peak in Taipei City, you will see the post
            on the peak says Mt. Cishing, instead of Mt. Qixing. As the popular
            hike to Mt. Teapot (add link), you will also see Cha Hu Shan, or Cha

            sometimes those Triangulation Stones are placed in the woods and
            there is no view to see. There are five Class 1 Triangulation Stones
            in Taipei City and New Taipei City, but you can only get a great
            view from three of them. The highest peak in Taipei City, Mt.
            Qixing, 1,120 meters (3,675 feet), also has a Class 1 Triangulation
            Stone. Not every summit will have those stones. Triangulation Stones

            Some local hiking associations will screen hikers’ physical
            conditions or their hiking experience for certain trails. However,
            there is also a gap between self-assessment and the reality. Every
            outdoor activity is different. Being good at running marathons
            doesn’t mean you will be fine with a long hike. I've met some new
            hikers (me included) who have exercise habits thought they could
            take on the more difficult hikes, but it turns out the trail is too
            much for them. We all misjudge sometimes, which is fine. If you
            think the trail is too much for you, please don’t feel embarrassed
            to let the guides know. Ask for help whenever you need, you and
            fellow hikers will thank you later.

            Another thing is the fear of height, or acrophobia. Sometimes, we

            things will not be too bad if you try not to look down. The worse

            fear of height, but I didn’t expect the slopes were so steep and
            there were almost no edges to put my feet. I still made it back, but
            it was really scary. Luckily, I saw one of the most fantastic views
            I've ever seen and that gave me some comfort. If you are not sure,

            C) Most of the Time, Rainboots Are Your Best Friend
          </h4>

            For hikers from different countries, it must surprise them a lot
            when they see local hikers wearing rainboots on the trails. Many
            even wear them to the 100 Peaks or in hot summer, including myself.
            Why are Taiwanese hikers so obsessed with rainboots?

            Even without muddy trails, it’s still very slippery on the trails.
            The humid weather is perfect for moss to thrive, and those tiny
            plants cover up the surface of the trails or rocks, which make them
            very slippery. Although hiking with rainboots doesn’t totally reduce
            the slippery on those trails, it indeed increases the friction
            compared to hiking boots. And, DON’T STEP ON THE GREEN ROCKS. Those
            are very slippery and may cause a great harm.

            I watch many YouTube videos about hikes on Pacific Crest Trail or
            Appalachian Trail, and the hikers seldom wear hiking boots on those
            long trails. They wear light weight trail shoes or running shoes. In
            Taiwan, this kind of footwear is not suitable and will make your
            miserable if you hike on the difficult terrains. Rainboots are bulky
            and heavy, and I have to say I’m not a big fan of them, but I still
            wear them on the trails. Before my hike, I will Google to see the
            trail condition to decide what I’m going to wear. Most of time, I
            just wear rainboots.

            It’s very easy to clean. Many trails locate in the mountains with
            the most precipitation in Taiwan. The muds there will never dry, no
            matter how hot or sunny it is. Some mud is so thick and sticky that
            your rainboots will get stuck in the mud when you walk into it.
            After a long day hike, the last thing you want to do is to clean up
            the dried mud on your hiking boots. As to rainboots, it’s so easy to
            clean up.

            Rainboots are very cheap. It cost around USD 10 to buy one pair.

            To be honest, the cost of my insoles can allow me to buy at least 7

            The weather is humid, and the landscape is like jungles, which is a

            and usually won’t give you bad reactions, and it’s very easy to get

            If the trails locate in other counties, many hiking associations
            will hire buses for the hikers or arrange carpool. Hikers pay the
            fee first when signing up. Some are one-day trips, and others are
            usually multi-day hikes. Hikers need show up on time at the meeting
            points and you can take a nap on the bus, bring extra clothing and
            leave them on the bus during your hike. The hikers who take those
            trips are also insured by the bus companies. I joined a hike like
            this a while ago and met some foreign hikers hoping to get a
            hitchhike. The driver didn’t take them because according to the
            driver, the bus company had to take responsibility if accidents
            happened. So, I guess if you want to hitchhike, you probably will
            have to ask for private cars or wait patiently for the bus to come.

            12. Boomer and Female Hikers Rock on the Trail
          </h3>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            Boomer hikers are the major demographic group on the trails in
            Taiwan. The interesting thing about hiking in Taiwan is it’s deemed
            as old people’s activity, because many people start hiking after
            they retire. I guess it’s because people think only middle-class has
            the leisure to participate recreational activities like hiking.

            In 2017, I joined a group hike, I was 45 years old at that time and
            I was also the youngest one. The oldest hiker I’ve ever met is an
            88-year-old grandpa, and he grabbed the rope gliding down the slope
            like anybody else. Nowadays, outdoor activities are getting popular
            in Taiwan. However, the younger generations seem more into
            triathlon, marathons, or cycling. You still can find young people on
            the trails. Another interesting thing is female hikers also take the
            majority on the trail.

            Taiwanese hikers enjoy taking group photos and they will change the
            poses several times, at least this is what I've observed, whether
            they are boomers or Millennials. Facebook groups are the most
            popular social media for hikers to connect and share hiking
            information and photos. Selfie sticks are popular, too. If you get a
            chance to hike with local hikers, be prepared to be asked for taking
            many photos with them. If you don’t hike with them, they might still
            ask for photos with you if they see you on the trails.

            Sharing food is common. Many friendly hikers, especially the guides,
            will bring extra fruit or snacks and share them with other hikers. I
            don’t have many international hiking experiences, so I am not sure
            this is also common in other countries. From the YouTube channels I
            watch, most hikers from other countries usually hike with their
            family or hiking mates. It will be fun to know how and what hikers
            in different countries do on the trails.

            Expect crowds and noise on the trials. Most of the hiking
            associations don’t set up a maximum number of hikers to join their
            hikes. Many people may show up if the weather is perfect. Sometimes,
            there might be even 100 or more hikers showing up. When it gets
            crowded on the trail, please remember to keep a certain distance
            from hiker in front of you if she or he uses trekking poles and keep
            yours near you as much as you can.

            You might find ropes on some steep slopes, but it can be difficult
            to use the ropes if the hikers behind you also grab the rope at the
            same time. I usually try to grab tree roots, pointed rocks, or
            strong grass if I climb steep slopes and avoid the rope as much as I
            can. Check to see whether the ropes are strong enough to hold your
            weight.

            Since the hiking groups can be very big, hikers in Taiwan have
            established a habit to inform those behind them about the trail
            condition ahead. For example, most hikers will say Xiǎo xīn tóu
            小心頭 ‘watch out your head’ if there are low branches, or Xiǎo xīn
            jiǎo 小心腳 ’watch out your feet’ if there are holes or big tree
            roots on the trails. This can prevent some injuries and it hurts so
            much to bump your head into the low branches. I’ve seen some serious
            cut on hikers’ heads when they accidently bump into the trees.

            return. Just in case something happens, and you fail to return to
            your hotel on time, they can ask for help on your behalf. In the

            even though you think the trail you pick is very easy, but sometimes
            they might be more difficult than you could have imagined. It’s even
            better if you can write a hiking trip plan and give it to people

            and Line to share the latest trips and photos and connect with
            members. If things come up or they must cancel the trips, they
            usually announce through Facebook. Some will send emails.

            15. Last but not Least, Always Have a Plan B
          </h3>
          <div class="article__section--content">
            The weather casts a major influence on whether you can hike or not.
            It's normal to have trips canceled or postponed due to the sudden
            weather change. For local hikers, this might be easy to solve. We
            just stay home. However, for international hikers, if your main goal
            is to hike the 100 Peaks, the sudden cancellation can be very
            frustrating. But safety first. All hiking trips will be canceled if
            the Central Weather Bureau in Taiwan issues typhoon alerts. If you
            still insist to go (if, surprisingly, the guide also agrees), it’s
            not fun to hike in a bad weather. You potentially put yourself and
            others in danger. I know you may not visit Taiwan again after this
            trip, which I hope you will, but there are still many things for you
            to enjoy during your stay if the weather is not in your favor.
            Always have a plan B, and this won’t hurt.
