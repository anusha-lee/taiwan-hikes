            70% of Taiwan is covered by mountains and complex terrains, which shapes special hiking culture. I like doing solo hikes, but I still join hiking associations for group hikes. The main reason is the safety, and the second one is I get to see the most beautiful views in Taiwan when hiking with groups. Without those associations, I don’t think I could get to those remote places. Therefore, I highly recommend visitors from other countries to hike with local hiking associations, because this will save you time to do research about the trails and, most importantly, you feel safe when hiking with the experienced locals.

            Most of those don’t have free guided hikes, and they offer
            customized hikes, too. However, if you consider a customized trip
            with them, please take those mentioned below into consideration
            carefully. Although you take the major responsibility of being safe
            on the trail, hiking with a qualified and good guide is still
            essential to whether you can have a great trip here in Taiwan.

          <div class="article__section--content">
            A few of those groups may be registered as companies, but many of
            them work like freelancers. Some guides start running their business
            and taking clients after hiking for a few years. Therefore, many of
            them may not have the qualifications as hiking guides and their
            background, experience and training of those guides can be varied.

          <div class="article__section--content">
            Technically, those are not legal in Taiwan. According to the
            regulations in Taiwan, you must have a travel agency license to run
            commercial trips and take clients. Many commercial hiking groups
            adopt different approach by working with travel agencies, but this
            is a grey area. Others just start taking clients without any license
            or certificates.

            The ideal guide-to-hiker ratio is 1 to 6 – 8, but following this

            Facebook and Line (an instant communication app like WhatsApp) are

          <div class="article__section--content">
            It’s also very important to discuss how to deal with the possible
            things or accidents happening before you go, for example, what to do
            when the weather is bad, if someone is injured or even dead, etc. In
            order to save money, some members will drive their own cars and
            others share the cost. However, when the car breaks down or gets
            into accident or a traffic ticket, what to do with the rest trip or
            the extra cost? For trips held by hiking associations, the lead
            guides have the authority to make the decisions agreed upon
            beforehand, and they’ve been trained to deal with emergencies. If
            the members of this social media group don’t reach consensus in

            As a hiker myself, I misjudge my physical condition sometimes, not

            do happen. Those things will affect your performance on the trail.
            The same things apply to your unknown hiking mates. They might think
            they should be okay on the trail, but there’s always a gap between
            the expectation and the reality. There are always some people who
            hike slower. If the physical conditions vary a lot among those
            strangers, who should lead the group and who should keep accompany
            with the slower ones? Those are things that might be beyond control
            if you hike with a bunch of strangers.

            climbing, navigation, survival skills, and right gear and clothing
            if they go for much more challenging hikes like the 100 Peaks.

            I joined a hiking trip with a local guide in Norway in 2017. Our
            Norwegian guide was professional, friendly and funny, and he knew
            the weather and the terrains very well, and could pick up the best
            dates for us to enjoy the most beautiful views. He also shared many
            local things with us, and that is exactly the point of traveling:
            learn new things from the locals. That's why I highly recommend
            visitors to hike with the local hiking associations, because you get
            to experience the local culture and people, and they know the trail
            well enough.
