            <h3>Background Story</h3>
            <div>
              Here’s a little background story about hiking in high mountains in
              Taiwan. Before 2001, if you wanted to hike the 100 Peaks, the
              elevation greater than 3,000 meters/ 9,842 feet above sea level,
              people had to go with licensed high mountain hiking guides and
              applied with registered hiking associations (<a
                href="https://mountainurbanite.com/2018/03/15/%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E5%B1%B1%E5%B2%B3%E4%BA%BA%E6%96%87%E8%AA%B2%EF%BC%9A%E8%87%AA%E7%B5%84%E9%9A%8A%E3%80%81%E5%95%86%E6%A5%AD%E5%9C%98%E5%92%8C%E5%B1%B1%E5%B2%B3%E5%8D%94%E6%9C%83/"
                target="_blank"
                >reference</a
              >, Chinese). During that time, hiking guides were quite well
              trained and many of them started hiking since college.
              <br />
              After this regulation was abolished in 2001, hiking with the
              associations is not the only option, and there are good and bad
              outcomes with the abolishment of this regulation. Sports
              Administration Ministry of Education in Taiwan has issued
              <a
                href="https://isports.sa.gov.tw/Apps/TIS05/TIS0501M_02V1.aspx?PKNO=544&MENU_PRG_CD=28&LEFT_MENU_ACTIVE_ID=147&SUB_PRG_CD=175"
                target="_target"
                >a new regulation</a
              >
              to regulate qualifications of the mountain activity guides. Most
              hiking associations also establish
              <a href="#">their training procedures</a> to build up their guide
              teams.

                  There are so many registered hiking associations in Taiwan and they have many well-trained and experienced guides. They have meetings regularly to decide which trails they are going to hike for the coming quarters. <a href="http://www.loho.org.tw/" target="_blank">Taiwan Mountain LOHAS Association</a> even requires their guides to check the trails at least once to make sure the trail condition is suitable before the trips are available, and some other groups will help clean up the fallen branches or debris if manageable. All the participants have to do is to check those associations’ schedules (link to free guided trips) for the information like difficulty ratings, length, etc., and show up at the meeting point on time.

                  For people who want to hike the 100 Peaks, hikers have to <a href="https://hike.taiwan.gov.tw">apply permits to the administrations</a> the <a href="https://np.cpami.gov.tw/home-en.html">National Parks of Taiwan</a> for legal entry and staying at the cabins or campsites, because most of the 100 Peaks locate in the National Parks. Hikers are not allowed to go there without applying and do wild camping, either. The main purpose is to prevent the vegetation and wildlife from too many human activities and forest fire. There are designated areas for hikers to use gas canisters to cook. For the popular hiking destinations, sometimes it can be really difficult to apply, especially for the local hikers, you have to remember when to apply in advance, and submit the application materials.

                  If you decide to hike with the hiking associations for the 100 Peaks, you just sign up, wait for the application results before paying the cost. If you are lucky enough and get a place at the cabin or the campsite, those associations will arrange pickups and decent hotels or B&B or even porters to carry your tents, sleeping bags and meals depending on what the trips provide, which can save weight you have to carry and a lot of time on figuring out how and when to get to the trail.

                  Although accidents may still occur even if you hike with a group, safety is still considered as the main concern why people join the group hikes. According to <a href="https://law.moj.gov.tw/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?pcode=H0120058" target="_blank">government regulations</a> (Chinese), qualified hiking guides must receive at least 48 hours of indoor and outdoor <a href="#">training</a>, and meet other requirements to become certificated.

                  Qualified hiking guides not only know how to survive, navigate and perform first aid in the wilderness, but, most importantly, also know the trails and potential risks very well to prevent any danger from happening beforehand. For example, experienced guides know the trail terrains well so they can warn the hikers when they traverse that area, or other things like wasp activities, etc. Of course, there are many unforeseen dangers, like sudden rains or collapsed slopes, but at least they are well aware of most of the trail conditions.

                  Another benefit is most hiking associations will arrange several guides to assist hikers. One will be the lead guide and she or he will ask hikers not to go before her or him, and one as the designated guide to be the last person in the group. They also arrange several guides in between hikers depending on the size of the group. If the hikers need any help, they will know who to turn to. So basically, the hikers will be surrounded by guides to make sure everyone is there. If something is up or someone is missing, the guides can react immediately, and they have enough guides to take care of the rest people.

                  I joined a challenging hike in March 2019, and there were three people who came from other country. They had hiking experience back home and they were also marathon runners, so they thought hiking in Taiwan shouldn’t be that difficult. It turned out to be a different story. The trail was muddy with fallen trees, entwined tree roots and steep slopes. Their running shoes got stuck in the mud all the time, and they lagged behind a lot and one guy’s shoes just gave up upon him. The female guide kept them company all the time, and our lead guide even got back on the trail to assist them after he settled us down at the campsite. They were late from the most of us for 3 hours, and they had to hike in the dark.

                  I personally think one the benefits of hiking with a group is to have some people there to keep you going. When you hike with a group, you and your hiking mates will be there to encourage and help each other. When I hiked on a long difficult trail, the thought of giving up and turning back came up from time to time, and my pace would get slower and slower. At this moment, some mental support from other hikers will help you continue and make it to the summit.

                  I once hiked on <a href="#">a high-altitude trail</a>, and the thin air and the lack of proper sleep made the ascending extremely hard for me. I stopped almost every three steps and had to rest, and the guide who was in a better condition than I was also followed my pace. I felt so sorry but very grateful for her patience and tolerance. It isn’t easy to slow your pace just to accommodate other hikers’ need, but I am very lucky to meet those great guides on the trails. But please also bear in mind that not every guide will be so patient, and some can even be mad at you, but they still keep you accompany.

                  Some guides even share their knowledge about the vegetation, trail history and how to survive in the woods. Some guides even go beyond and prepare free trail food or snacks for hikers to enjoy. When you hike in a cold weather and your guides boil hot water and hand you a cup of hot drink, it feels like heaven.

                    There are many easy-access trails in Taiwan, but there are more trails that we don’t know about. With the hiking associations, I've been to many beautiful trails since 2017. Gradually, I build up a pocket list of trails (link) that I definitely will hike again. If you hike regularly and want to experience special trails when you visit Taiwan, I definitely will recommend you.

          2. Enjoy Free-guided Hikes with Super Inviting and Friendly Local
          Hiking Communities
        </h3>
        <div class="article__content">
          Because of the special landscape, hiking activities are thriving and
          there are many registered hiking associations that offer free guided
          trips almost everyday, and you have more options on the weekends. For
          most of the hikes, you can just show up on time at the meeting points,
          meet new people, and enjoy the hike.
          <br />
          If you opt to multi-day adventures, for a reasonable amount of money,
          you can just sign up and those hiking associations will take care of
          the application process of mountain cabins or campsites and
          transportation, which is totally hassle free. (Read more:

          <br />
          The average age of hikers in Taiwan is relatively older than other
          countries, and the female hikers take the majority. Many of them are
          experienced hikers and even have finished hiking
          <a href="#" target="_blank">the 100 Peaks</a> in Taiwan and sometimes
          it's difficult for younger people to keep up with their pace.
          <br />
          They are also very welcoming and friendly, and will take care of you.
          Some of them even prepare extra trail foods, like fresh fruit, iced
          drinks, etc., which is a big delight on the trail. Some of the hikers
          speak English, so you don’t have to worry that it’s difficult to
          communicate with local hikers.

          4. All Kinds of Trails to Meet Your Hiking Buds: from Easy Roaming to
          Challenging Ones
        </h3>
        <div class="article__content">
          There are all kinds of trails with different difficulty ratings for
          you to choose. Some trails can even allow you to decide you want to
          take the easy part, the difficult part or all of them, for example,
          the Mt. Teapot Trail (article link). If you have young children, many
          trails are family friendly and small children can easily enjoy the
          hike.
          <br />
          Since Taiwan is a small island, many trails allow you to enjoy the
          magnificent mountain and ocean views at the same time. Some trails are
          very steep and require hikers to have a strong biceps because you have
          to grab the rope or tree roots to get yourself up or down. Some parts
          of the trails are on the narrow ridges and it can be very scary to
          walk on them. Some are covered with barren rocks and you can see the
          deep valley down below. If you are not afraid of height, those trails
          will be great to explore. (Read more:

          <br />
          Other than the nature, some trails have stories behind them. Since the
          history of Taiwan can be traced back to several hundreds of years ago,
          some old trails were made for porters to transport goods during that
          time. Although many are replaced by modern highways, you still can
          find the relics in the woods. Local governments maintain many

          and apply for your stay in advance, you can go hiking whenever you are
          available.
          <br />
          In summer, we like to hike at higher attitudes to avoid the heat.
          Summer is also a good time to hike the 100 Peaks, because you can
          bring less gear. It might rain often, and it still rains due to
          orographic precipitation even the weather forecast says the chance of
          rain is low. Therefore, it’s important to prepare a raincoat with you
          when hiking. For local hikers who hike on a regular basis, it's normal
          to hike in the rain.
          <br />
          For people who like water activities, it is very easy to find creeks,
          rivers, waterfalls, or lakes along the trails. You can also find
          several high elevation lakes above in Taiwan. For example, hike to

          7. Wonderful Foods for Breakfast, Lunch and Post-hiking Meals
        </h3>
        <div class="article__content">
          Last but not least,
          <a
            href="https://eng.taiwan.net.tw/m1.aspx?sNo=0002026"
            target="_blank"
            >the food</a
          >. Many breakfast restaurants (it's literally translated from Chinese,
          早餐店) open as early as 5 am or run business 24 hours, so you can
          stop by to buy foods for your breakfast and lunch.
          <br />
          I usually buy Fan Tuan, which is made of sticky rice with some
          fillings like fried bread sticks and pork floss, or vegetarian
          ingredients. Fan Tuan is very fulfilling and easy to carry during the
          hike. Or you can bring Ramen and ask whether the guides can help you
          boil water.
          <br />
          In Taiwan, Ramen is not just for broke college students. Some
          expensive ones are with a small meat package inside. You can find all
          kinds of Ramen products at the supermarkets, for example, luxury or
          cheap ones, Taiwanese brands, or brands from South Asia, South Korea,
          or Japan.
          <br />
          If you are still not sure, there are convenience stores everywhere and
          you can get bread, Ramen, hot foods, snacks, drinks etc. for your
          trail food. As to the post hiking meals, as long as you can reach any
          MRT station in Taipei, it's very easy to get to the famous
          restaurants.
          <br />
          Furthermore, you don't have to go to Shilin Night Market to enjoy the
          food, there are usually many restaurants near big MRT stations. Most
          noodle restaurants serve beef noodle soups if you want to try. There
          are also many vegetarian restaurants. As to my favorite post hiking
          meals, they are fried chicken and bubble tea (boba). Those things are
          almost everywhere in Taiwan.
