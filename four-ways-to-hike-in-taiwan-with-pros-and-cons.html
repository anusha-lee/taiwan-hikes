            <h3>Background Story</h3>
            <div>
              Here’s a little background story about hiking in high mountains in
              Taiwan. Before 2001, if you wanted to hike the 100 Peaks, the
              elevation greater than 3,000 meters/ 9,842 feet above sea level,
              people had to go with licensed high mountain hiking guides and
              applied with registered hiking associations (<a
                href="https://mountainurbanite.com/2018/03/15/%E5%8F%B0%E7%81%A3%E5%B1%B1%E5%B2%B3%E4%BA%BA%E6%96%87%E8%AA%B2%EF%BC%9A%E8%87%AA%E7%B5%84%E9%9A%8A%E3%80%81%E5%95%86%E6%A5%AD%E5%9C%98%E5%92%8C%E5%B1%B1%E5%B2%B3%E5%8D%94%E6%9C%83/"
                target="_blank"
                >reference</a
              >, Chinese). During that time, hiking guides were quite well
              trained and many of them started hiking since college.
              <br />
              After this regulation was abolished in 2001, hiking with the
              associations is not the only option, and there are good and bad
              outcomes with the abolishment of this regulation. Sports
              Administration Ministry of Education in Taiwan has issued
              <a
                href="https://isports.sa.gov.tw/Apps/TIS05/TIS0501M_02V1.aspx?PKNO=544&MENU_PRG_CD=28&LEFT_MENU_ACTIVE_ID=147&SUB_PRG_CD=175"
                target="_target"
                >a new regulation</a
              >
              to regulate qualifications of the mountain activity guides. Most
              hiking associations also establish
              <a href="#">their training procedures</a> to build up their guide
              teams.

                  There are so many registered hiking associations in Taiwan, and they have many well-trained and experienced guides. They have meetings regularly to decide which trails they are going to hike for the coming quarters. <a href="http://www.loho.org.tw/" target="_blank">Taiwan Mountain LOHAS Association</a> even requires their guides to check the trails at least once to make sure the trail condition is suitable before the trips are available, and some other groups will help clean up the fallen branches or debris if manageable. All the participants have to do is to check those associations’ schedules (link to free guided trips) for the information like difficulty ratings, length, etc., and show up at the meeting point on time.

                  For people who want to hike the 100 Peaks, hikers have to <a href="https://hike.taiwan.gov.tw">apply permits to the administrations</a> the <a href="https://np.cpami.gov.tw/home-en.html">National Parks of Taiwan</a> for legal entry and staying at the cabins or campsites, because most of the 100 Peaks locate in the National Parks. Hikers are not allowed to go there without applying and do wild camping, either. The main purpose is to prevent the vegetation and wildlife from too many human activities and forest fire. There are designated areas for hikers to use gas canisters to cook. For the popular hiking destinations, sometimes it can be really difficult to apply, especially for the local hikers, you have to remember when to apply in advance, and submit the application materials.

                  If you decide to hike with the hiking associations for the 100 Peaks, you just sign up, wait for the application results before paying the cost. If you are lucky enough and get a place at the cabin or the campsite, those associations will arrange pickups and decent hotels or B&B or even porters to carry your tents, sleeping bags and meals depending on what the trips provide, which can save weight you have to carry and a lot of time on figuring out how and when to get to the trail.

                  Although accidents may still occur even if you hike with a group, safety is still considered as the main concern why people join the group hikes. According to <a href="https://law.moj.gov.tw/LawClass/LawAll.aspx?pcode=H0120058" target="_blank">government regulations</a> (Chinese), qualified hiking guides must receive at least 48 hours of indoor and outdoor <a href="#">training</a>, and meet other requirements to become certificated.

                <div class="procon__box--content article__content">
                  Qualified hiking guides not only know how to survive, navigate and perform first aid in the wilderness, but, most importantly, also know the trails and potential risks very well to prevent any danger from happening beforehand. For example, experienced guides know the trail terrains well so they can warn the hikers when they traverse that area, or other things like wasp activities, etc. Of course, there are many unforeseen dangers, like sudden rains or collapsed slopes, but at least they are well aware of most of the trail conditions.

                  Another benefit is most hiking associations will arrange several guides to assist hikers. One will be the lead guide and she or he will ask hikers not to go before her or him, and one as the designated guide to be the last person in the group. They also arrange several guides in between hikers depending on the size of the group. If the hikers need any help, they will know who to turn to. So basically, the hikers will be surrounded by guides to make sure everyone is there. If something is up or someone is missing, the guides can react immediately, and they have enough guides to take care of the rest people.

                  I joined a challenging hike in March 2019, and there were three people who came from other country. They had hiking experience back home and they were also marathon runners, so they thought hiking in Taiwan shouldn’t be that difficult. It turned out to be a different story. The trail was muddy with fallen trees, entwined tree roots and steep slopes. Their running shoes got stuck in the mud all the time, and they lagged behind a lot and one guy’s shoes just gave up upon him. The female guide kept them company all the time, and our lead guide even got back on the trail to assist them after he settled us down at the campsite. They were late from the most of us for 3 hours, and they had to hike in the dark.

                  I personally think one the benefits of hiking with a group is to have some people there to keep you going. When you hike with a group, you and your hiking mates will be there to encourage and help each other. When I hiked on a long difficult trail, the thought of giving up and turning back came up from time to time, and my pace would get slower and slower. At this moment, some mental support from other hikers will help you continue and make it to the summit.

                  I once hiked on <a href="#">a high-altitude trail</a>, and the thin air and the lack of proper sleep made the ascending extremely hard for me. I stopped almost every three steps and had to rest, and the guide who was in a better condition than I was also followed my pace. I felt so sorry but very grateful for her patience and tolerance. It isn’t easy to slow your pace just to accommodate other hikers’ need, but I am very lucky to meet those great guides on the trails. But please also bear in mind that not every guide will be so patient, and some can even be mad at you, but they still keep you accompany.

However, when the car breaks down or gets into accident or a traffic ticket, what to do with the rest trip or the extra cost? For trips held by hiking associations, the lead guides have the authority to make the decisions agreed upon beforehand, and they’ve been trained to deal with emergencies.

                        This person should know your gear, physical condition, trail plans, food supply, etc., in case that things happen. That person will know when to call for help and might be able to know your possible location for the rescue team to find you as soon as possible. This person is required if you want to apply for the permit to hike the 100 Peaks in Taiwan.

                    I joined a hiking trip with a local guide in Norway in 2017. Our Norwegian guide was professional, friendly and funny, and he knew the weather and the terrains very well, and could pick up the best dates for us to enjoy the most beautiful views. He also shared many local things with us, and that is exactly the point of traveling: learn new things from the locals. That's why I highly recommend visitors to hike with the local hiking associations, because you get to experience the local culture and people, and they know the trail well enough.

                  Last but not least, one thing should be born in mind is hiking should be labeled as an outdoor sport, not sightseeing, from my humble opinion. Hiking and sightseeing require different levels of physical strength, clothing, gear, and knowledge toward the activities, the nature and risk managements. Besides, hiking involves greater dangers which might cause injuries or even death.
